Annotation. In the cited article, the unity of the general and professional development of
the individual is one of the basic principles of human development, the essence of which can be
considered as a concept that serves not only during the educational process, but also in the
process of acquiring knowledge, developing their general and special abilities, qualities and
skills, as well as in the professionalization and further improvement of the formed knowledge,
qualities, abilities, etc. Our analysis of the current state of higher education reveals the following
principles of modernization of education: globalization and internalization; forecasting and
utilization; marketization; standardization; territorialization; axiologization, etc. It is worth
noting that higher education is important not only in terms of modernization, but also from the
point of view of reforms and innovative development. Ways of further expanding and
implementing this important factor were shown.
Keywords: prognostic, psychological, professional, modernization, forecasting,

Introduction: professional preparation is the expression of a clear and conscious decision
related to the choice of a specific type of labor activity or profession, which is directly related
to the goal-oriented work carried out with students. Thus, professional adaptation can be viewed
as the mutual integration of individual components of the processes that develop the need for
pedagogical activity in the future specialist, educate a responsible and creative approach to it,
the motivation of social values, and acquire a person-oriented orientation. Pedagogical and
psychological aspects of professional adaptation of personnel In the theoretical study, analysis
and justification of the social relevance of the research problem, it is expedient to highlight the
content of significant concepts and categories within the scope of the topic. Therefore, in the
course of scientific research, we tried to shed light on the pedagogical and psychological aspects
of professional adaptation by clarifying the essence of such concepts as: motive, motives for
choosing a profession, professional orientation, orientation to the pedagogical profession,
pedagogical activity, professional knowledge, skills and qualifications, competence.
The concept of a profession is an occupation that requires special training, constantly
experiences a person and serves as a source of livelihood for him. A profession unites people
engaged in the same activity, and certain ties and moral norms are established within this
activity. E.A. Klimov emphasizes in his research that "A profession is a necessary and valuable
sphere for society, which requires physical and mental strength from a person." V.G. Makushin,
on the other hand, emphasizes that a profession is an activity through which a person participates
in the life of society and serves as the main source of material means for his livelihood.
Summarizing the existing definitions, we can conclude as follows: "A profession is the main
form of labor activity, for the performance of which a person must have certain knowledge,
qualifications and skills, special abilities and developed important professional qualities." A
specialty is a set of special knowledge, skills and qualifications in the work process, acquired
through vocational education and training, which are necessary for performing a certain type of
activity within a particular profession. Thus, a specialty is a type of professional activity within
a profession, which is aimed at achieving personal achievements or general results through
specific situations. One of the conditions for the effectiveness of professional activity is the
professional readiness of a specialist. The famous Russian psychologist I.K. According to
Platonov, "professional preparation is a subjective state of a person who considers himself
capable and prepared to perform the necessary professional activity and strives to perform it."
E. Seykhalilov, B. Rakhimov and N. Azizkhodjaeva explain that "professional preparation is
the process of mastering theoretical knowledge, skills and qualifications that allow a person to
engage in a specific type of professional activity." R. Ishmuhamedov, A. Abdukodirov and A.
Pardaev emphasize that the basis of professional preparation should reflect "the psychological,
psychophysiological, physical and scientific-theoretical and practical preparation of the future
5

specialist." Based on the authors' opinions, the concept of "professional training" can be defined
as follows:
Professional training is the level of physiological, psychological and physical readiness
of a person to carry out professional activities based on the acquisition of special theoretical
knowledge, practical skills and qualifications, as well as spiritual and moral qualities. The
formation of professional training is the process of forming special theoretical knowledge,
practical skills and qualifications in a person based on qualification requirements, as well as the
physiological, psychological and physical preparation of a future specialist for the successful
conduct of professional activities.
Professional preparation means the assimilation of the requirements of professional
activity of a future specialist, their individualization. As is known, one of the important tasks of
each higher educational institution is to ensure the positive adaptation of its students to the new
system of education, new social relations, and the successful assimilation of the status of a
student.
When adapting students to the conditions of a higher educational institution, the
following aspects should be highlighted:
1) the course of the adaptation process in students has a complex dynamic and requires
the mutual coordination of value concepts of social and personal importance;
2) the first and, in some cases, the second year of study for students is accompanied by
difficult situations;
3) in the process of studying at a higher educational institution, students develop a sense
of self-awareness, and the development of a system of value relations towards the world around
them and being continues;
4) basic educational institutions are formed in students
5) student years have an organizational, methodological and psychological character and
are the most important stage of professional and personal adaptation of a person. In fact,
professional training is a complex and multifaceted process, the main criteria of which are the
opportunities that ensure successful work in a particular profession, the orientation of the
person, professional knowledge, skills, qualifications and professional qualities, and work
experience. As we know, a person is an active object and subject of the educational process, and
his activity in the process of professional adaptation of future professionals is determined by his
orientation. Studying the problem of personality orientation, S.L. Rubinstein expresses it in
terms of needs, interests, ideals, beliefs, priority motives of activity and behavior, and
worldviews. Psychologists L.I. Bozovich and R.S. Nemov interprets personal orientation as a
system and a set of motives. Professional orientation is a specific form of personal orientation,
reflected in the influence of motives and needs.
In the literature on pedagogical and vocational education, attention is paid to the fact that
the concept of "professional orientation" means the following:
6

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

1) "Professional orientation" - a person's ability, interests, needs and firm belief in a
specific type of activity (A.B. Seyteshev);
2) "Professional orientation" - the relationship between the choice of a profession,
interest, firm belief and the leading role of the motives for choosing a profession in personal
qualities (N.K. Stepankova). In the works of some researchers, attempts are made to reveal the
essence of the concept of "orientation to the pedagogical profession", taking into account the
orientation of a person directly to a specific professional activity.
Including:
1) "Orientation to the pedagogical profession" - a person's "interest in the pedagogical
profession and the desire to engage in this type of activity" (N.V. Kuzmina);
2) "Orientation to the pedagogical profession" - an attitude towards children, enthusiasm
for pedagogical work, pedagogical observation skills. As can be seen from the terminological
analysis, the concept of "preparation for the pedagogical profession" mainly reflects the fact
that the choice of a profession affects the student's professional preparation under the active
influence of motives. The concept of motive is interpreted in psychological literature (from
Latin movere - to move) - as a motivating reason for activities related to satisfying certain needs.
Choosing a profession is a complex and motivational process, and the right choice of a
profession by a person leads to a person's satisfaction with life and a clear determination of his
social status. Research scientist E.S. Chugunova developed a classification of motives for
choosing a workplace and profession, defining the motives for choosing a profession, which
reflect the reasons for any professional activity, as follows:
- dominant (predominance of interest in the profession);
- situational (realization of the conditions that have always interested a person);
- conformist; other professional motivations (with the advice of the social world close to
him, that is, relatives, friends and acquaintances).
A.K. Baymetov, studying the motives of striving for pedagogical activity, unites the main
ones:
a) the motive of inevitability (obligatory);
b) the interest and attraction of the subjects being taught;
c) entering into communication with children.
According to the studied sources, types of motivation affect the direction and character
of the professional training of future professionals.
In this regard, N.V. Kuzmina emphasizes that the motives of a person's orientation to the
pedagogical profession are of three types:
1) real pedagogical;
2) formally pedagogical;
3) false pedagogical orientation.
Although the motivations for choosing a profession are more clearly manifested in the
orientation to professional activity, it is necessary to take into account that they alone cannot
7

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

play a leading role in the formation of professional training. Because the fact that the existing
physical, mental and spiritual capabilities of a person are proportional to the level of
requirements that the chosen professional activity places on the person contributes to the normal
adaptation of students to the professional activity environment and the formation of reflection.
Professional capabilities reflect the objective conditions of a certain activity associated
with the will of the person. Usually, when adapting future professionals to professional activity,
it is considered appropriate to approach them based on their objective capabilities, identify the
capabilities of the person with the requirements of the chosen profession and activity. For
example, when choosing a teaching profession, not only the love of this profession, the desire
to communicate with children, but also the fact that the physical, psychological and social
requirements of professional activity for a person are within his capabilities, contribute to the
acquisition of professional knowledge, qualifications and skills. Therefore, in the professional
adaptation of future professionals, special attention should be paid to the theoretical
substantiation of these aspects of the issue and the development of the professional capabilities
of future specialists. The initial potential readiness of future professionals for professional
activity is the basis of their current practical readiness. Therefore, in the process of forming
professional training in educational institutions, it is necessary to form professional knowledge,
qualifications and skills in students sufficient for the implementation of professional activity.
Professional knowledge is a combination of information necessary for work performed
within a specific labor activity and acquired theoretical knowledge. The determination of the
professional knowledge that future professionals must master based on the content of the
qualification requirements for the quality level of a specialist is considered an important
criterion determining the effectiveness of the professional adaptation process.
Conclusion: The classifier, which embodies the quality requirements for future
professionals, determines that future professionals must have the necessary professional
knowledge, qualifications and skills to work in general education schools, academic lyceums,
vocational colleges, technical schools and universities and to be able to organize the educational
process within their specialty, fairly assess and control the level of knowledge of students.
Therefore, it is considered appropriate to pay attention to the fact that in the specialized
description of future professionals, based on the qualification requirements for their professional
preparation, the content of professional knowledge is determined in relation to the following
professional qualities.

BOSHLANG‘ICH SINF O‘QUVCHILARIDA O‘ZINI O‘ZI QADRLASHNI
SHAKLLANTIRISHNING PSIXOLOGIK SHARTLARI
M.Isaxanova
Qo‘qonDPI o‘qituvchisi
Annotatsiya Mazkur maqolada kichik maktab yoshidagi o‘quvchilarning o‘z-o‘ziga
munosabati, uning belgilari va shakllanish jarayonlari ijtimoiy-psixologik nuqtayi nazardan
ko‘rib chiqilgan. Qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga munosabatning aqliy rivojlanishga ta’siri va o‘z-o‘zini
baholash darajasi sinflar bo‘yicha farqlanishi tahlil qilingan. Bu omillar o‘quvchilarning shaxsiy
rivojlanishi va ijtimoiy moslashuvi uchun qanday ahamiyatga ega ekanligi yoritilgan.
Kalit so‘zlar: kichik maktab yoshi, qadriyatlar tizimi, psixologik omillar, madaniy
qadriyatlar, o‘z- o‘ziga baho, psixoprofilaktik va psixokorreksion dastur.
Аннотация В данной статье рассмотрены с социально-психологической точки
зрения самоотношение младших школьников, его признаки и процессы формирования.
Проанализировано влияние ценностного отношения к себе на психическое развитие и
дифференциация уровня самооценки по классам. Освещается, как эти факторы важны

Kirish. Kichik maktab yoshi bolalik davrining muhim va o‘ziga xos bosqichidir. Ushbu
davrda bolalarning psixologik rivojlanishi va sezgirligi yuqori darajada bo‘lib, bu ularning ko‘p
qirrali rivojlanishiga katta imkoniyatlar yaratadi. Boshlang‘ich maktab yoshidagi bolalarning
psixologik xususiyatlarini chuqur o‘rganish, o‘qituvchilarga ta’lim va tarbiya jarayonini
samarali tashkil etishga yordam beradi.
O‘qituvchilar, shuningdek, bolalarning o‘z-o‘ziga munosabatining aqliy rivojlanishga
ta’siri va o‘z-o‘zini baholash darajalarini hisobga olishi zarur, chunki bu ularning individual
ehtiyojlarini qondirishga va ta’lim jarayonini yanada samarali tashkil etishga yordam beradi.
Ota-onalar uchun ham bolalarning psixologik xususiyatlarini tushunish muhimdir, chunki bu
ularning farzandlari bilan munosabatlarini to‘g‘ri yo‘lga qo‘yishga imkon yaratadi.
Shunday qilib, boshlang‘ich maktab yoshidagi bolalarning psixologik xususiyatlarini
o‘rganish, ularning shaxsiy rivojlanishi va ijtimoiy moslashuvini qo‘llab-quvvatlashda muhim
ahamiyatga ega.
Mazkur yosh davrida qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabatni shakllanish darajasini
oshirishda asosiy vosita, o‘quvchilarning hayotga muvaffaqiyatli moslashishi va jamiyatga
10

integratsiyalashuvidir. Bunga erishish uchun esa shaxsning ijobiy subyektivligini rivojlantirish
zarurdir.
Bizning fikrimizcha, kichik maktab o‘quvchilarining boshlang‘ich ta'lim bosqichida
muvaffaqiyatli integratsiyalashuvi, o‘ziga ijobiy munosabatni rivojlantirishda muhim shart
sifatida ko‘rilishi lozim. Bu jarayon ko‘p jihatdan o‘qituvchilar, ota-onalar va tengdoshlar bilan
o‘rnatilgan munosabatlarga bog‘liqdir.
Kichik maktab yoshidagi o‘quvchilarning shaxs sifatida shakllanishi bir qator psixologik
omillar bilan chambarchas bog‘liqdir. Ularning qadriyatlar tizimi, o‘ziga va boshqalarga
nisbatan munosabatlarining shakllanishi bilan izohlanadi. Shu nuqtayi nazardan, mazkur yosh
davrida qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabatni shakllanganlik darajasini o‘rganish muhim
ahamiyatga ega. Aynan kichik maktab yoshidagi o‘quvchilarda qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan
munosabatni shakllanishiga ta’sir etuvchi psixologik omillarni tadqiq qilish, muammoga
nisbatan yangi yondashuvlarni ishlab chiqishga olib keladi.
Psixologik tadqiqotlarda kichik maktab yoshi o‘quvchilarda qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan
munosabatni shakllanganlik darajasi turlicha tahlil etilgan. Xususan, L.S.Vigotskiy fikricha,
maktabda o‘qish proksimal (yaqin) rivojlanish zonasini yaratish uchun asos bo‘lishi bilan
tavsiflanib, dastlab kattalar va tengdoshlar bilan hamkorlik sohasida faollashadi, keyin esa
bolaning ichki holatiga aylanadi [4]. Shuningdek, L.S.Vigotskiy shaxsning rivojlanishi uni
madaniy qadriyatlarni o‘zlashtirishi bilan belgilanishini, bu muloqot jarayoni orqali amalga
oshishi, xususan, bolaning kattalar bilan bevosita ijtimoiy aloqalarida paydo bo‘lishini
ta’kidlaydi. Shunday qilib, boshlang‘ich sinflarda yangi faoliyat va o‘zgargan muloqot
sharoitlari bolaning o‘zini o‘zi qadrlashini shakllantiradigan baholash munosabatlarini
rivojlantirishga yordam beradi.
Shuningdek, rivojlanishining ushbu davrida xulq-atvorning axloqiy jihatlariga
qo‘yiladigan talablar sezilarli darajada, xususan, o‘z yutuqlari va muvaffaqiyatsizliklarini
baholash imkoniyati yuzaga keladi.
D.B.Elkoninning ta'kidlashicha, bola maktabga kelganida uning voqelik bilan
munosabatlarining butun tizimi qayta qurishdan o‘tadi hamda kattalar bilan munosabatlarning
yangi tuzilishi paydo bo‘ladi [10, 115].
T.Yu.Andrushchenkoning so‘zlariga ko‘ra, kichik maktab o‘quvchisining o‘zini o‘zi
qadrlashi nafaqat uning o‘quv qobiliyatiga va o‘qituvchining sinf bilan muloqot qilish
xususiyatlariga, oilaviy tarbiya uslubi va oilada qabul qilingan qadriyatlar tizimiga bog‘liqligi
bayon etilgan [1,125].
Boshlang‘ich maktab yoshida bolalar o‘z xatti-harakatlarini va aqliy jarayonlarini
boshqarishni o‘rganadilar. Ushbu davrda maktabdagi talablarga javob berish, irodani
rivojlantirish uchun muhim omil hisoblanadi, shuning uchun boshlang‘ich sinf o‘quvchisida
o‘zini-o‘zi axloqiy qadrlashning quyidagi motivlari mavjud: 1) ichki: axloqiy yo‘naltirilganlik,
shaxsning axloqiy o‘zini-o‘zi qadrlashi; 2) tashqi: oila muhitida ota-onalar, o‘qituvchilar,
11

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

axloqiy baholash madaniyati va sinfda o‘zini o‘zi qadrlash madaniyatini rag‘batlantirish [8, 912].
Kichik maktab o‘quvchilarining shaxsiy o‘zini-o‘zi qadrlashi va ularning yosh
xususiyatlarini shakllantirish muammosiga bag‘ishlangan adabiyotlarning nazariy tahlili
"kichik maktab o‘quvchilarining o‘zini-o‘zi qadrlashi" tushunchasining mazmunini
aniqlashtirishga imkon berdi. Kichik maktab o‘quvchilarining o‘zini-o‘zi qadrlashi — bu
shaxsning o‘z qobiliyatlari to‘g‘risidagi bilimlar tizimiga asoslangan holda, o‘z xattiharakatlarini, ta'lim faoliyati jarayonini va natijalarini baholash zarurati va qobiliyatida
namoyon bo‘ladigan shaxs sifatida talqin etiladi. Bu jarayon yoshga bog‘liq shaxsiy rivojlanish
tizimi bilan belgilanadi va o‘z-o‘zini bilishning tashkiliy jarayoniga qaratilgan faoliyatni o‘z
ichiga oladi.
Shunday qilib, o‘z-o‘zini hurmat qilishning shakllanishi boshlang‘ich maktab yoshining
butun davriga hamroh bo‘ladi. Bu jarayonda bolalar o‘z harakatlari va operatsiyalarining
bajarilishi, sifatini aniqlash yoki ularning to‘g‘riligini tekshirish uchun oldindan bajarilgan
harakatlarni qayta ko‘rib chiqish orqali o‘zlarini baholashni o‘rganadilar. Bu esa bolalarning
shaxsiy rivojlanishi va ijtimoiy munosabatlarni tushunishida muhim rol o‘ynaydi.
I.P.Podlasovning fikricha, kichik maktab yosh davridagi bolalar shaxsining shakllanishi
kattalar (o‘qituvchilar) va tengdoshlar bilan yangi munosabatlar, yangi faoliyat va muloqot
turlari, yaxlit tizimga jamoalarni kiritish ta’siri ostida sodir bo‘ladi. Kichik maktab yoshidagi
bolalarda ijtimoiy hissiyotlar shakllanadi, ijtimoiy xulq malakalari rivojlanadi (jamoaviylik,
xulqi uchun javobgarlik, o‘zaro yordam) [7,73].
N.V.Bordovskaya va A.A.Reanning ilmiy ishlarida bu yosh davrida shaxslararo
munosabatlar, asosan, emotsional asosda qurilishi ta’kidlanadi. Odatda shaxslararo muloqot
malakalari zaif rivojlangan bo‘ladi. Kichik maktab yoshidagi bolalar refleksiya, ijtimoiy
mas’uliyat, moslashuvchanlik, ijtimoiy maqbul xulqni og‘zaki ifodalash qobiliyatining yuqori
darajasini ifodalaydilar [3, 81]. Bundan tashqari, bu yosh davrida kattalar bilan ilk bahslar ham
yuzaga keladi.
S.Freydning klassik psixoanalizida insonning xulq-atvori ongsiz instinktiv harakatlarga
asoslangan bo‘lib, ular biologik ehtiyojlarni qondirish uchun turtki bo‘lib xizmat qilishi
keltirilsa-da, zamonaviy tadqiqotchilar M.S.Yanitskiyning so‘zlariga ko‘ra, bir qator
zamonaviy Freydning uch a'zoli shaxs tuzilishining har qanday elementi qadriyatlar manbayi
va joylashuvi bo‘lib xizmat qilishi mumkinligi, G.Diligenskiy fikricha, super ego ijtimoiy
me'yorlar va qadriyatlarni o‘z ichiga oladi, ego esa idning ongsiz stimullarini o‘stirish natijasi
bo‘lgan individual qadriyatlarni o‘z ichiga olishi. Bunda ego qadriyatlari umume'tirof etilgan
qadriyatlar tizimiga qaraganda "kuchliroq va haqiqiyroq" bo‘lishi. V.E.Chudnovskiyning
tahlilicha, shaxsning ongsiz sohasidagi ko‘plab stimullar, o‘z navbatida, ongli ravishda qabul
qilingan axloqiy qadriyatlarga asoslanishini ta’kidlaydilar [11].

Tadqiqotimiz keltirilgan yondoshuvlarga asoslangan holda, kichik maktab yoshidagi
o‘quvchilarning ijtimoiy me'yorlar va qadriyatlar asosida o‘zini o‘zi adekvat baholashini
aniqlash maqsadida V.G.Shur va S.G.Yakobson tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan bolaning o‘zini o‘zi
qadrlash xususiyatlarini o‘rganishga qaratilgan “Zina” metodikasidan foydalanildi.
Metodika boshlang‘ich sinf o‘quvchilarning o‘zini o‘zi qadrlashini o‘rganishga
qaratilgan bo‘lib, ushbu usul nafaqat psixologlar, balki o‘qituvchilar va ota-onalar uchun ham
o‘z farzandini yaxshiroq bilish, uning o‘zini shaxs sifatida qanday baholashini tushunish,
o‘quvchining o‘zini o‘zi qadrlashini aniqlash va olingan natijalar asosida zarur psixoprofilaktik
va psixokorreksion tarbiya usullarini ishlab chiqish uchun imkoniyat yaratadi.
Tadqiqotimizda 150 nafar sinaluvchilar, ya’ni kichik maktab yoshi birinchi va to‘rtinchi
sinf o‘quvchilari ishtirok etib, ularning o‘ziga o‘zi bahosi yosh xususiyatlaridan kelib chiqqan
holda muayyan darajada turlichaligi aniqlandi (1- jadval).

o‘quvchilarining o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan bahosi sinflar kesimida muayyan darajada farqli
ko‘rsatkichlarga egaligi aniqlandi.

Mulohaza. Bunda o‘quvchining o‘zini qaysi darajaga qo‘yganiga e'tibor berganimizda,
asosan, sinaluvchilarimiz xarakter xususiyatlari va ijtimoiy-psixologik holatlaridan kelib
chiqqan holda turlicha ko‘rsatkichlar bilan farqlandi.Tadqiqotda muayyan sinaluvchilar
o‘zlarini "juda yaxshi" va xatto "juda yaxshi" bolalar darajasiga qo‘yishlari odatiy hisoblanadi.
Past ko‘rsatkichga ega bo‘lgan sinaluvchilar pozitsiyasi adekvat bahoni emas, balki o‘ziga

nisbatan salbiy munosabatni, o‘z qobiliyatiga ishonchsizlikni anglatishi aniqlandi. Bu esa
ularning shaxslararo munosabatlari va o‘quv faoliyati tizimida nisbatan qiyinchiliklarni kelib
chiqishiga sabab bo‘ladi. Shuningdek, statistik ko‘rsatkichlarda 4-sinf o‘quvchilarining
aksariyati o‘zlarini "yaxshi" deb hisoblaydilar va zinapoyaning yuqori pog‘onalariga
qo‘yadilar. Bunga ularning yosh va individual xususiyatlari, tashqi obyektlarga nisbatan
munosabatlari sabab bo‘lishi kuzatiladi.
Demak, kichik maktab yoshidagi o‘quvchilarda qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabat
shakllanishi psixologik jihatdan juda muhimdir. Bu esa bolalarning o‘zini anglash darajasi va
ijtimoiy munosabatlariga ta'sir qiladi. Ushbu jarayon, bolalarning shaxsiy rivojlanishi va
ijtimoiy moslashuvi uchun juda muhimdir. Quyida bu jarayonning asosiy jihatlari keltirildi:
Kichik maktab yoshida bolalar o‘zlikni anglash jarayonida bo‘ladilar. Bu davrda ular
o‘zlarini qanday ko‘rishlari, qobiliyatlarini qanday baholashlari va o‘zlariga nisbatan
munosabatlarni shakllantiradilar. O‘zlikni anglash, bolalarning o‘ziga bo‘lgan ishonchiga ta'sir
qiladi.
Kichik maktab yoshidagi bolalar ijtimoiy qadriyatlarni va axloqiy me'yorlarni
o‘rganishda ota-onalari, o‘qituvchilari, do‘stlari va hayotiy tajribalaridan foydalanadilar. Ushbu
jarayon ularning shaxsiy rivojlanishi va ijtimoiy moslashuvi uchun juda muhimdir. Ijobiy muhit
va qo‘llab-quvvatlash bolalarning ijtimoiy qadriyatlarini shakllantirishda muhim ahamiyatga
ega.
Do‘stlik, hamkorlik va raqobat kabi ijtimoiy munosabatlar kichik maktab yoshidagi
bolalar uchun muhimdir. Ushbu munosabatlar orqali bolalar o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabatlarini
yanada rivojlantiradilar. Do‘stlarining fikrlari va baholashlari bolalarning o‘ziga bo‘lgan
munosabatini kuchaytirishi yoki pasaytirishi mumkin. Ushbu jarayonni to‘g‘ri boshqarish va
qo‘llab-quvvatlash bolalarning shaxsiy rivojlanishiga va ijtimoiy hayotda muvaffaqiyatga
erishishlariga yordam beradi.
Bolalar emotsional jihatdan rivojlanayotgan davrda, ularning hissiyotlari va histuyg‘ulari o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabatlariga ta'sir qiladi. O‘zini yaxshi his qilish,
muvaffaqiyatlarga erishish va emotsional qo‘llab-quvvatlash bolalarning o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan
munosabatini ijobiy tomonga o‘zgartirishi mumkin.
Agar bolalarda psixologik muammolar (masalan, depressiya, xavotir) mavjud bo‘lsa, bu
ularning o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabatiga salbiy ta'sir ko‘rsatishi mumkin. Bunday holatlarda
professional yordamga murojaat qilish zarur.
Ota-onalar bolalarning qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan munosabatini shakllantirishda
muhim rol o‘ynaydilar. Ular bolalarga namuna bo‘lishlari, ularni qo‘llab-quvvatlashlari va
mehr berish orqali ularning o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan ishonchlarini oshirishlari mumkin. Ushbu
jarayonni to‘g‘ri boshqarish va qo‘llab-quvvatlash bolalarning shaxsiy rivojlanishiga va
ijtimoiy hayotda muvaffaqiyatga erishishlariga yordam beradi.
Xulosa. Kichik maktab yoshidagi o‘quvchilarda qadriyatli o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan
munosabatning shakllanishi ko‘plab psixologik omillarga bog‘liqdir. Ushbu jarayonni to‘g‘ri
14

boshqarish va qo‘llab-quvvatlash bolalarning shaxsiy rivojlanishiga va ijtimoiy hayotda
muvaffaqiyatga erishishlariga yordam beradi. Bu borada amaliy psixologlardan oilaviy
shaxslararo munosabatlar hamda ta’lim tizimida shaxsni o‘z-o‘zini adekvat baholashga
yo‘naltiruvchi psixoprofilaktik va psixokorreksion dastur va modellarni ishlab chiqish hamda
tatbiq etish talab etiladi.

Kirish. Jahonnong ilmiy markazlarida ta’lim sifatini oshirish, ilmiy dunyoqarashni
shakllantirishga bag‘ishlangan ko‘plab zamonaviy ilmiy tadqiqotlar o‘tkazilib, yechimlari
ishlab chiqilgan bo‘lsada, o‘quv faoliyatining o‘ziga xos mexanizmlari va turli guruhlardagi
talabalarni o‘qitishning individual psixologik xususiyatlarini o‘rganish dolzarbligicha
qolmoqda. Oliy ta’lim va ilmiy muassasalarida ilmiy dunyoqarash, mustaqil fikrlash, aqliy
salohiyat muammolarini uning o’quv faoliyati muvaffaqiyatiga asos sifatida qaralib,uni
intellektual shakllantirishga doir ilmiy tadqiqotlar olib borilmoqda. Global Creativity Index
(GCI) ning hisobotida keltirilishicha ilmiy-amaliy, ijod sohasini qo‘llab-quvvatlash darajasi
yuqori bo‘lgan mamlakatlarda ilmiy dunyoqarash shakllantirish ko‘rsatkichi o‘sganligi bilan
tavsiflanadi. Bu borada,axborotlar tezkor almashinuvi, informatsion xilma-xillik sharoitida
talabalar ta’limini tashkil etishda zamonaviy texnologiyalar asosidagi ta’limning
modernizatsiyalashgan usullarini qo‘llash, intellektual salohiyatini kuchaytirish orqali
intellektual yoshlar jamoasini shakllantirish, iqtidorli talabalarni kompetentli etib tayyorlash,
talabalar intellektini shakllantirishda o’quv maskanlarining ta’lim sharoitini o‘zgartirib
o‘qitishni tashkil etishga yo‘naltirilgan ijtimoiy-psixologik tadqiqotlarga alohida e’tibor
qaratish zarurati kuzatilmoqda. [1].
Respublikamizda so‘nggi yillarda yoshlar doimo davlat va jamiyat diqqat markazida
ekanligi sababli mustahkam huquqiy asosga ega kuchli yoshlar siyosati olib borilmoqda.
«O‘quv dasturlari asosida bilim, malaka va ko‘nikmalarni o‘zlashtirishi, mashg‘ulotlarda
qatnashishi, ularga mustaqil tayyorgarlik ko‘rishi, pedagog xodimlarning topshiriqlarini
bajarishi shart» ekanligi ustuvor vazifa sifatida belgilangan. Bu borada, mamlakatimizda ilmfanni yanada ravnaq toptirish, yoshlarimizni chuqur zamonaviy bilim, yuksak maʼnaviyat va
madaniyat egasi etib tarbiyalash, mustaqil fikrlaydigan yuqori malakali kadrlar tayyorlash
jarayonini sifat jihatidan yangi bosqichga ko‘tarish, oliy ta’limni modernizatsiya qilish, o‘quv
samaradorligi va talabalar o‘zlashtirishini oshirishga qaratilgan psixologik taklif va tavsiyalar
ishlab chiqish zarurati yuzaga kelmoqda. [2].

Natija va muhokama.
Bizning tadqiqot ishimizda tаlаbаlаrdа ilmiy dunyoqarashni rivоjlаnishida yuzaga
keluvchi muammolarni pedagogik-psixologik yechimlari hamda tadqiqot obyektlaridan olingan
natijalarning qiyosiy tahlili keltirilgan.
Bugungi kunda talabalarni ilmiy dunyoqarash darajasini o’rganish ularni o’quv faolligini
oshirish masalalariga alohida etibor qaratilmoqda. Shu sababli tadqiqot ishimizda talabalarni
ilmiy faoliyatga keng jalb etish, qobiliyatlar tizimini shakllantirish milliy ta’lim tizimini
jahonda munosib o‘z o‘rinni egallashga qaratilgan zamonaviy tizimni yaratish tadqiqotimizda
ustuvor vazifalardan biri sifatida belgilangan. Bunday vazifalarni talabalarda bor imkoniyatni
aniqlab, uni rivojlantirmasdan hal etib bo‘lmaydi. Shu boisdan, talabalarni fikrlash darajasiga
ta’sir etuvchi omillar asosida ishlab chiqilgan ijtimoiy-psixologik so’rovnomamiz orqali tajriba
va nazorat guruhlaridagi talabalardan eksperimentdan oldin hamda keyingni natijalarni
tahlillarini keltirdik.

Olingan natijalardan ko‘rinib turibdiki, biz tomonimizdan taklif etilgan rivojlantiruvchi
dastur talabalarda ilmiy dunyoqarash xususiyatlariga ta’sir etuvchi omillarning namoyon etish
darajasini rivojlanishiga olib kelishi kuzatilgan. So’rovnomaizning dastlabki “ilmiy fikrlash”
omilida ishonchli farqlar qayd etildi (t=-2,3; p≤0,05). Talabalarda muammolarni qanday hal
qilish va qarorlar qabul qilish haqida maʼlumot berish uchun xulosalar chiqarish jarayoni,
kognitiv jarayonlar hamda tafakkur uslublarining rivojlanganligidan dalolat beradi.
“Tanqidiy fikrlash” omilida ham ahamiyatli farqlar kuzatildi (t=-2,7; p≤0,05). Mazkur
omilni rivjlanishi talabalardagi ilmiy dunyoqarash sifatlariga, axborotlarni qayta ishlashda
faktlarni tahlil qilish, har qanday ilmiy-amaliy ma’lumotlarga sinchikovlik bilan etibor berish
kabi sifatlar oshishiga ham olib kelar ekan. Bunda tashqari tanqidiy fikrlash ko'nikmalarini
samarali shakllantirish uchun ularni turli fanlar bo‘yicha integratsiya qilish, kasbiy faoliyat
bilan o’zaro bog’lash maqsadga muvofiqdir. [3].
“Mustaqil fikrlash” omilida ham sezilarli darajada o’sish bo’lganligini ko’rishimiz
mumkin (t=-2,9; p≤0,05). Psixokorreksion dasturdan so‘ng talabalarda mustaqil qaror qabul
qilish, o‘z ustida ishlash, o‘z qarashlarini ifodalashdagi dadillik, muffaqiyatga intilish, faoliyat
natijasini baholashga adekvatlikni ortganligini bilan belginaladi.
So’ngi “Amaliy fikrlash” omilida ham ishonchli farqlar aniqlandi (t=-1,9; p≤0,05).
Mazkur holat amaliy fikrlash darajasi yuqori bo’lgan o’smirlarda muammoga nazariy jihatdan
emas, balki amaliy ravishda yondashish, muhokama davomida mavzuga diqqat etibor qaratish,
muammolarni nafaqat nazariy jihatdan balki, amaliy jihatlarini ham tahlil qila olish
ko’nikmasiga ega bo’lishadi. Xulosa qilib aytadigan bo’lsak, sinaluvchilarimzda ilmiy
dunyoqarash, o‘z ustida ishlash, faoliyatini rejalashtirish ko‘nikmalari ham sezilarli darajada
ortganligi kuzatilgan. Nazorat guruhida esa natijalar orasidagi o‘zgarishlar ahamiyatli emasligi
aniqlang. Mazkur ko‘rsatkichning o‘ziyoq psixologik trening dasturimizning samaradorlik
darajasiniko‘rsatib beradi.
Nazorat guruhlarida esa mazkur mezonlar bo‘yicha yaqqol bir ko‘rinishdagi statistik
tafovutlar aniqlanmadi. Olingan empirik ma’lumotlarning ishonchliligi Styudent t-mezoni
bo‘yicha asoslandi. Ushbu tahlillar ko‘lami psixologik trening dasturlarining samaradorligidan
dalolat beradi.
Xulosa. Talabalarda ilmiy dunyoqarashni shaklantirishning ijtimoiy-psixologik
xususiyatlari o’rganish bo‘yicha olib borilgan tadqiqot natijalari nazariy-amaliy jihatdan
quyidagi xulosalarni shakllantirish imkonini berdi:
Talabalar ilmiy dunyoqarashini shakllantirish ta’lim samaradorligini aks ettiruvchi va
nafaqat ta’lim sifatini baholashga qaratilgan, balki ta’limning tashqi va ichki xususiyatlarini
ham o‘z ichiga olgan murakkab jarayondir, chunki u ta’lim sharoitlari va natijalarining xilmaxilligi, talabaning hissasi, shu jumladan o‘quv natijalarining tuzilishini o‘zida namoyon etadi.
Ijtimoiy-psixologik kategoriya sifatida “ilmiy dunyoqarash” ta’lim natijalarini tushunishga
aynan mos keladi degan pozitsiyaga asoslanadi, chunki u ta’lim muvaffaqiyatiga yaxlit

Zamonaviy dunyoda talabalik inson hayoti davri sifatida alohida o‘rin tutadi. Shubhasiz,
har bir insonda bu davr o‘ta individual tarzda kechadi. Shu bois, shaxsning imkoniyatlar
darajasini ochib beradi va insonning kattalar olamidagi o‘rnini belgilaydi. O‘z navbatida
ko‘plab tadqiqotlarda talabalar o‘rtasida o‘tkazilgan so‘rovnomalarning natijalarini taqqoslab,
shunday xulosaga kelish mumkinki, ularda bir qator umumiy psixologik xususiyatlar mavjud
bo‘lib, ularni rivojlantirish orqali talabaning umumlashtirilgan ijtimoiy-psixologik portretini
yaratish mumkin.
Zamonaviy talaba tushunchasining mazmunini quyidagicha izohlash maqsadga
muvofiqdir. Jumladan, keyingi intellektual rivojlanish uchun katta imkoniyatlarga ega bo‘lgan
va zamonaviy jamiyatning, xususan, 17 yoshdan 25 yoshgacha bo‘lgan insonlarning eng muhim
aqliy salohiyatini belgilab beruvchi
yoshlar, alohida ijtimoiy guruh - talabalardir.
G.A.Melekesovning ta’kidlashicha, “Talabalik davri - bu hayotga bo‘lgan o‘z qarashlarini va
individual hayot tarzini aniqlash va amalga oshirishda haqiqiy mualliflikni shakllantirishning
boshlanishidir” [3].
O’z navbatida, talabalik yosh inqirozi - yangi ijtimoiy rollarga moslashish davri sifatida
namoyon bo’ladi. Xususan, jamiyatda shaxsning mavqeini mustahkamlaydigan, o’z ustida
shaxsiy ish olib boradigan, o’z javobgarligining yangi darajasiga, o’zini o’zi tashkil etishning
yangi talablariga, kelajakda o’z imkoniyatlarini muvaffaqiyatli va to’g’ri ro’yobga chiqarish
uchun zarur bo’lgan o’quv mehnatining nafaqat aqliy chegarasi bilan maktab mehnatidan farq
qiladigan yangi sharoitlariga, lekin ta’limni davom ettirish muhim ijtimoiy, ma’naviy va
psixologik qadriyat ekanini talabaning o’zi ham tushunadi.
Bugungi kunda talabalarning ijtimoiy tarkibi yetarlicha xilma-xil bo‘lib, kunduzgi ta’lim
shaklida o‘qiyotgan, ota-onalarining to‘liq ta’minotida bo‘lgan oddiy talabalar, shuningdek,
sirtqi va kechki ta’lim shaklida o‘qiyotgan, farzandlari, oilasi, ishi bor, xususiy tadbirkorlik
bilan shug‘ullanayotgan talabalar hisoblanadi. Navbatdagi muhim guruh oliy ma’lumotli yoki
ilmiy darajaga ega mutaxassislar oilasidan chiqqan talabalar, shuningdek, ota-onalari turli
sohalarda xususiy biznes bilan shug‘ullanadigan oilalardan chiqqan talabalar vakillaridir.
Talabalar hayotining boy mazmuni zamonaviy jamiyat sharoitida zarur bo‘lgan ta’lim,
kasbiy tayyorgarlik va qayta tayyorlash muddatlarini kengaytirish bilan ham, zamonaviy
22

jamiyatda yoshlarga bo‘lgan alohida munosabat bilan ham bog‘liq. Inson faoliyatining ko‘plab
nufuzli turlari muhim yosh cheklovlarini o‘z ichiga oladi va ijtimoiy ongda yoshlik bilan uzviy
bog‘liq bo‘ladi.
Yoshlikda inson ijodiy faoliyatga, o‘zi uchun yangi g‘oyalarni aniqlashga eng qobiliyatli,
maksimal darajada ishchan bo‘ladi. Shuning uchun zamonaviy fan va texnika taraqqiyoti
haqidagi tasavvurlar ko‘p jihatdan yoshlar bilan bog‘liq. Ikkinchi tomoni - ko‘proq psixologik
- mafkura va dunyoqarashni o‘zida mujassam etadi.
XX asrning o‘rtalariga qadar yoshlar dunyoqarashi keng ko‘lamli ijtimoiy va madaniy
jarayonlarga bu qadar faol va yaqqol ta’sir ko‘rsatmagan. Yoshlar va kattalar jamoasi
o‘rtasidagi munosabatlarda mafkuraviy va psixologik to‘ntarish XX asrning 60-70 yillarida
sodir bo‘ldi. Talabalar inqilobi, rasmiy mafkuralar, madaniy va diniy qoidalarni inkor etish shu
qadar keng ko‘lam kasb etdiki, bu yoshlarning ham, keksa avlodning ham o‘zini o‘zi anglashida
sezilarli o‘zgarishlarni paydo bo‘lishiga olib keldi. 70 yillar oxiriga kelib ehtiroslar oqimi
tinchlanib, yoshlar modasi turli ko‘rinishlariga ega bo‘ldi. Ammo bu burilishning izlari ijtimoiyyosh stratifikatsiyasida va uni o‘rganuvchi fanlarda, xususan, psixologiya va sosiologiyada
saqlanib qolgan.
Ye.V. Shchepkina MDU talabalarida motivasiya namoyon bo‘lishining tarixiysosiologik o‘rganish natijasida quyidagilarni ta’kidlaydi:
- 20-40 yillardagi o‘qish motivlari orasida yoshlarning bilimga, madaniy qadriyatlarga
intilishi, o‘qishga bo‘lgan qiziqishi alohida ajralib turardi. Bu yillarda yoshlar oliy o‘quv
yurtlariga yuqori bilim olish uchun bordilar;
- 50-60 yillarda - yalpi sanoatlashtirish davrida motivlar texnologik tushunchaga
asoslangan;
- 70 yillarda kasb egallash motivi yetakchi bo‘lgan;
- 80 yillarda qiziqarli mazmunli ish bilan shug‘ullanish va o‘z qobiliyatlarini to‘liq
qo‘llash imkoniyati, shuningdek, jamoada hurmat qozonish imkoniyati yuqori baholangan;
- 90 yillar boshida oliy o‘quv yurtini tamomlaganlik to‘g‘risidagi diplomni olish istagi
yetakchi motiv bo‘lgan;
- 1994 yildayoq motivlar tuzilishi o‘zgarmoqda. Yuqori ma’lumotli, madaniyatli inson
bo‘lish (58%), hayotda muvaffaqiyatga erishish (54%), karera qilish (37%), muayyan ijtimoiy
mavqega ega bo‘lish (20%) qadriyatlari yetakchilik qilmoqda [2].
Shuni ta’kidlash kerakki, hozirgi talabalar avlodi o‘z o‘tmishdoshlaridan ancha farq
qiladi. Zamonaviy talabalar industrial jamiyatdan axborot va ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy islohotlarga
o‘tish jarayonida voyaga yetdilar.
Shu tufayli yosh avlod o‘zgaruvchan sharoitlarga yuqori darajada moslashuvchanlik va
shu bilan birga ularning salbiy komponentlariga ta’sirchanlik xususiyatiga ega. Shundan kelib
chiqib, talaba shaxsining qadriyatli-motivatsion shkalasi quyidagi sifatlar bilan ifodalanadi:
ishbilarmonlik, tanqidiylik, tashabbuskorlik, ijodkorlik, shuhratparastlik, mehnatsevarlik,
23

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

rahmdillik, mas’uliyatlilik, punktuallik, vatanparvarlik, katta avlodga hurmat (umuminsoniy
axloqiy qadriyatlar) ikkinchi darajaga tushib qolgan.
Talabalik davrining asosiy psixologik xususiyatlaridan biri kelajakka intilishdir. Talaba
shaxsini rivojlantirishning muhim omili hayotiy rejalarni tuzish va amalga oshirishdir.
Shunday qilib, talabalik davrining markaziy psixologik ta’limi o‘z taqdirini o‘zi
belgilashga intilish va kelajak uchun hayotiy rejalar tuzishdir. Ta’lim jarayonida talaba
shaxsining qadriyatli o‘zini o‘zi belgilashi A.V. Kiryakovaning tadqiqotlariga ko‘ra,
bosqichma-bosqich amalga oshiriladi:
I. Shaxs tomonidan jamiyat qadriyatlarini o‘zlashtirish: talabaning o‘z dunyoqarashini
shakllantirish jarayoni, “Olam qiyofasi” qadriyatli mexanizmlar natijasi sifatida: izlash baholash.
II. Jamiyatning qadriyatlarini o‘zgartirish va qadriyatlar olamida o‘zini anglash:
talabaning sub’yektiv fikriga, uning o‘ziga xosligiga asoslanadi. Natijada “Men obrazi”
shakllanadi: “Men – realman”, “Men – idealman”, “Men – konsepsiya” bo‘lib, baholash tanlash qadriyatli mexanizmlarining in’ikosi hisoblanadi.
III. Jamiyatning bilimlari, me’yorlari va ko‘rsatmalari asosida o‘z hayotiy pozisiyasini
loyihalash va qurish: talabaning qadriyat yo‘nalishlarini shakllantirish jarayonining yakuniy
bosqichi bo‘lib, u hayotiy pozisiyalarning rivojlanishini ta’minlaydi, chunki bu yerda xulosa
qadriyat mexanizmlarining ishlashi jarayonida “Kelajak obrazi” hisoblanadi: tanlov –
proyeksiya [4].
Talabalikning o‘ziga xos xususiyatlaridan yana biri obro‘-e’tibor va talabchanlik kabi
muhim omil hisoblanadi. Jumladan, bir necha yil oldin universitetlarning yuridik fakultetlariga
kirishni xohlovchilar soni boshqa fakultetlarda ajratilgan o‘rinlar sonidan bir necha baravar ko‘p
edi. Shuningdek, ushbu masalada, bugungi kunda universitetni tanlashda uning ahamiyati
muhimdir. Bu esa talabalik davri psixologiyasining o‘ziga xos xususiyatlari shakllanishini
oldindan belgilab beradi.
Yoshlarning kasbiy rejalariga turli omillar ta’sir ko‘rsatadi: ota-onalar, o‘qituvchilar,
do‘stlarning fikrlari, kitoblar, ko‘rsatuvlar va boshqalar. Biroq, boshqa tomondan, oliy
ma’lumot olishga bo‘lgan umumiy intilish shaxsiy intilishlar va fazilatlarni unchalik xolisona
baholamaslikka olib keladi. Shuning uchun ko‘pchilik “vaziyatga bog‘liqlik” tamoyiliga amal
qiladi. Ya’ni, oliy ma’lumotning mavjudligi alohida ta’lim oluvchi uchun tanlangan kasbning
dolzarbligidan muhimroq hisoblanadi. Qaysi universitetda bo‘lishidan qat’i nazar, o‘qishga
kirish uchun ham xuddi shu tamoyil asosida universitet tanlanadi. Ammo talaba uchun uning
hayotining asosiy mashg‘uloti o‘quv-kasbiy faoliyatdir. Shuning uchun o‘qishga munosabat
ko‘rsatkichlari, uning muvaffaqiyati, o‘quv faoliyati motivlari shaxsning ijtimoiy shakllanishi
uchun eng muhim mezonlardir.
Abituriyentlarni oliy o‘quv yurtlariga qabul qilishda katta tanlov bo‘lishiga sabab,
aksariyat maktab o‘quvchilari uchun oliy ta’lim juda yuqori qadriyat hisoblanadi.
Universitetlarga kirishda turli maktablarda dars berishdagi barcha xatolar aniqlanadi.

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Universitetlarning muvaffaqiyati turli fakultetlarga qabul qilingan talabalarning sifatiga
bevosita bog‘liq. Shuni e’tiborga olish kerakki, talabaning ta’limning dastlabki bosqichida
bo‘lajak mutaxassislik, zarur qobiliyat va ko‘nikmalar, faoliyat xarakteri, mutaxassisga
qo‘yiladigan ijtimoiy va psixologik talablar haqida to‘liq ma’lumotga ega bo‘lmasligi natijasida
tanlangan kasbdan ko‘ngli qoladi. Shuningdek, bugungi kunda mehnat bozori mutaxassisga
nisbatan ancha qat’iy talablarni shakllantirdi. Bu esa u yoki bu lavozimga talablar darajasi
o‘rtasida katta raqobatbardoshlikni ta’minlaydi. Shuning uchun zamonaviy mutaxassis nafaqat
texnik ko‘nikmalarga, balki harakatchanlik, tashabbuskorlik, tadbirkorlik, mustaqillik, g‘ayrat
kabi shaxsiy fazilatlarga ham ega bo‘lishi kerak.
Ilmiy adabiyotlarda ta’kidlanishicha, shaxs munosabatida talaba yoshi axloqiy va estetik
his-tuyg‘ularning faol rivojlanishi, dunyoqarash pozisiyasini, xarakterning shakllanishi va
barqarorlashuvi va, ayniqsa, katta yoshli insonning fuqarolik, ijtimoiy-siyosiy, kasbiy, mehnat,
oilaviy kabi ijtimoiy rollarining to‘liq majmuasini egallash davri sifatida alohida ahamiyatga
ega. Bunda talabaning yangicha tafakkuri - bu zamonaviy dunyoqarash, aniq dunyoqarash
pozisiyasi shakllanadi.
Mustaqil, axloqiy va mas’uliyatli xulq-atvor talabaning muayyan fazilatlarga ega
bo‘lishini taqozo etadi:
- onglilikning yuqori darajasi;
- murakkab hayotiy vaziyatlarda to‘g‘ri yo‘l topa olish;
-boshqa odamlar bilan aloqa o‘rnatish qobiliyati;
-o‘z xulq-atvorlarini boshqarish odati;
-mas’uliyatli qarorlar qabul qilish qobiliyati [1].
Dinamik hayot shaxsning axloqiy ishonchliligiga yuqori talablar qo‘yadi, u eng
murakkab, kutilmagan vaziyatlarda muammoni hal qilish uchun eng maqbul insonparvar
tanlovni amalga oshirishi kerak. Talabaning axloqiy tarbiyasi qadriyatli yo‘nalishlar, hayotiy
rejalar, maqsadlar, ideallar va intilishlar, muloqot madaniyatini ishlab chiqishni nazarda tutadi.
O‘z navbatida, iqtisodiy muammolarni hal qilish ko‘pincha odamlarning ma’naviy
jihatdan tayyor emasligiga duch keladi. Har bir talabada mas’uliyatning to‘liqligi, ijtimoiy
faollik, o‘zini o‘zi tarbiyalash va o‘zini o‘zi tashkil etish qobiliyatini tarbiyalash shaxsni
shakllantirishning muhim omilidir. Talaba o‘z majburiyatlarining ijtimoiy ahamiyatini
qanchalik chuqur anglasa, uning ijtimoiy yetuklik darajasi shunchalik yuqori bo‘ladi.
Talaba-yoshlar muhim ijtimoiy guruh, jamiyatning ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy va ma’naviyaxloqiy rivojlanishiga ta’sir ko‘rsatuvchi muhim kuchdir. Motivatsiyaning, butun qadriyat
yo‘nalishlari tizimining o‘zgarishi, bir tomondan, kasbiylashuv bilan bog‘liq maxsus
qobiliyatlarning jadal shakllanishi, boshqa tomondan, bu yoshni shaxs shakllanishining
markaziy davri sifatida ajratib ko‘rsatadi.
Bugungi kunda talaba-yoshlarga, bir tomondan, ichki kasbiy motivatsiyaning yetarli
emasligi, ikkinchi tomondan, kuchli hissiy ta’sirchanlik, tanlangan kasbda o‘zini namoyon
qilish, o‘zini o‘zi namoyon qilish istagi xosdir. Bu borada talabalarning kasbiy faoliyatga

tayyorgarligini shakllantirishning pedagogik-psixologik usullari alohida dolzarblik kasb etadi.
Binobarin, hamkorlikdagi harakatlar natijasidagina talaba ijtimoiy qadriyatlarning tashuvchisi,
pirovardida esa o‘zini o‘zi anglash va kasbiy mas’uliyati rivojlangan ijtimoiy foydali shaxsga
aylanishi mumkin.
Ma’lumki, talabalik davrida shaxs sifatlarini shakllanishi o‘ziga xos ahamiyatga ega
bo‘lib, unda yosh, jins hamda atrofdagi insonlarning ta’siri muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Shu
o‘rinda talaba shaxsida muloqotdagi qyinchiliklarni namoyon bo‘lishiga shaxs sifatlarini
ta’sirini o‘rganish muhim hisoblanadi. O‘z navbatida mazkur hodisalar o‘rtasidagi o‘zaro
aloqadorligi masalasini tekshirishga muvaffaq bo‘lindi. Buning uchun sinaluvchilar guruhida
“Muloqotdagi psixologik qiyinchiliklarni diagnostika qilish” metodikasi (V.A. Labunskaya
tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan) va “Shaxs sifatlarini o‘rganish” so‘rovnomalaridan (Kettell
tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan) foydalanildi. Tadqiqot jarayonida to‘plangan ma’lumotlar miqdor
va sifat jihatidan tahlil qilinib, jadvallarda aks ettirildi.

sifatlari o‘rtasida o‘zaro differensial farqli jihatlar ko‘zga tashlanadi. Shunga muvofiq quyidagi
xulosalarni shakllantirish maqsadga muvofiq hisoblanadi.
-talabalik davrida shaxs sifatlarini shakllanishi ulardagi o‘quv-kasbiy faoliyatga
tayyorgarlik negizida amalga oshirilishi mumkin;
-talabalik davrida muloqotdagi qiyinchiliklarni yuzaga kelishi muloqotchanlik-yopiqlik,
hissiy barqarorlik-beqarorlik, hukmronlikka intilish-tobelik, o‘zini tuta bilish – ekspressivlik
bilan o‘zaro ahamiyatli bog‘liqlikka ega ekanligi qayd qilindi;

Hаyоtning аlоhidа sub’еktlаri - оng tаshuvсhilаri hаqidа mulоhаzа yuritishni
K.Lеvinning fikri bilаn tо’ldirish mumkin, u shахsiy оnggа yаngi fаzilаtlаrni kiritish judа kо’p
mеhnаt tаlаb qilаdigаn vа qiyin jаrаyоn еkаnligini tа’kidlаdi [1].
Shахs dunyоqаrаshining rivоjlаnishi dоimо jаmiyаtdаgi ijtimоiy-siyоsiy jаrаyоnlаr bilаn
сhаmbаrсhаs bоg’liqdir. Zаmоnаviy tа’lim hоlаtining о’zigа хоs хususiyаti - bilim
pаrаdigmаsining shахsgа yо’nаltirilgаnligigа о’tishi, bu bаrсhа аsоsiy pеdаgоgik
kо’rsаtmаlаrni, shu jumlаdаn tаlаbаlаrining dunyоqаrаshni shаkllаntirishdа qаytа kо’rib
сhiqishni tаlаb qilаdi. Hаr bir dаvr ijtimоiy tuzilishgа, fаn vа tа’limning rivоjlаnish dаrаjаsigа
mоs rаvishdа dunyоqаrаshni shаkllаntirish mаsаlаlаrini hаl qilаdi.
G.V.Grасhеvning fikriсhа, ilmiy dunyоqаrаsh аsоsini tаshkil еtuvсhi umumlаshtirilgаn
nаzаriy bilimlаrni shаkllаntirishning muhim shаrti о’qitishdа bilishning diаlеktik usulining
аsоsiy tаmоyillаrini аmаlgа оshirish bо’lib, ungа kо’rа tаlаbаlаrlаr individuаl, аlоhidа fаktlаrni
о’rgаnishdаn yаshirin qоnuniyаtlаrni аniqlаshgа hаrаkаt qilishаdi. G.V.Grасhеvning fаlsаfiy,
umumilmiy bilim vа nаzаriyаdаn о’quv fаоliyаtidа tizimli fоydаlаnish ulаr hаqidаgi
g’оyаlаrning tоbоrа сhuqurrоq vа mаzmunli tushunсhаlаrgа аylаnishigа хizmаt qilishini
kо’rsаtаdi. Muаyyаn bоsqiсhdа tаlаbаlаr bilimidаgi miqdоriy о’zgаrishlаr sifаtgа аylаnаdi [2].
Tаdqiqоtсhilаrning аniqlаshiсhа, dunyоqаrаsh bilimlаrini о’zlаshtirish jаrаyоnidа
inkоrni inkоr еtishning diаlеktik qоnuni hаm о’zini nаmоyоn qilаdi. Dunyоqаrаsh dunyоgа,
ijtimоiy оngning bаrсhа shаkllаrigа munоsаbаt bilаn bеlgilаnаdi, dеgаn fikrgа kеlib, uning
bоlаlаrdа shаkllаnishi аstа-sеkin, kоnsеntrik vа ziddiyаtli tаrzdа аmаlgа оshirilаdi, dеgаn fikrgа
kеldilаr.
Psiхоlоglаr (L.I.Bоjоviсh, А.N.Lеоntiеv, D.B.Bоgоyаvlеnskаyа vа bоshqаlаr) оddiy
bilimlаrni о’rgаtish, аniqlаshtirish yоki аlmаshtirish оrqаli оlingаn ilmiy bilimlаrgа аsоslаngаn

Tаdqiqоtсhilаr dunyоqаrаshni shаkllаntirishning yоsh dinаmikаsini аniqlаdilаr. Ulаr
shuni kо’rsаtаdiki, rivоjlаnishning tаlаbаlik dаvridа bоlаlаr аlоhidа о’quv fаnlаrini о’rgаnishgа
ishtiyоq bilаn kirishаdilаr vа оngli rаvishdа hаyоt hаqidаgi оddiy tushunсhаni ilmiy bilаn
аlmаshtirаdilаr. Tаdqiqоtсhilаrning аniqlаshiсhа, tаlаbа оngidа qаdriyаtlаrni qаytа bаhоlаsh,
ilmiy g’оyаlаr ufqlаri kеngаyishi vа tushunсhаlаr сhuqurlаshishi kuzаtilаdi. Bungа bilimlаrni
е’tiqоdgа аylаntirishning еng muhim hаrаkаtlаntiruvсhi kuсhi bо’lgаn о’z-о’zini tаrbiyаlаsh vа
о’z-о’zini tаrbiyаlаshgа bо’lgаn intilishning аstа-sеkin kuсhаyishi yоrdаm bеrаdi.
Psiхlоgiyik аdаbiyоtlаr tаhlili shuni kо’rsаtаdiki, hаqiqаtning оngdа tаsdiqlаnishi, uning
ishоnсhgа аylаnishi hаyоtdа mаvjud bо’lgаn vа ijtimоiy fаоliyаtning mа’nаviy аsоsi bо’lgаn

- kоllеktivizm, о’zаrо yоrdаm, dо’stlik.
Ushbu kоmpоnеntlаrning birligi tаlаbаlаrning ilmiy dunyоqаrаshini shаkllаntirishning
psiхоlоgik yахlitligini tа’minlаydi. Shundаn kеlib сhiqib, dunyоqаrаshni shаkllаntirishgа tа’sir
еtuvсhi quyidаgi psiхоlоgik-pеdаgоgik shаrt-shаrоitlаr аniqlаnаdi:
- ilmiy jаrаyоndа fаnlаrаrо аlоqаdоrlik sаmаrаdоrligini оshirаdigаn bilim fаоliyаti;
- о’quv jаrаyоnidа tаlаbаlаrning intеllеktuаl fаоliyаtining psiхоlоgik аsоsi bо’lgаn
bilimgа bо’lgаn qiziqish;

shахsning о’zini о’zi bоshqаrishi, psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrligini tа’minlаsh, о’z о’zini аnglаshi,
fikrlаsh tаrzi, qаdriyаtlаri tizimi, mоtivаtsiоn bеlgilаri (yо’nаlgаnlik, hаyоtiy mаqsаdlаr, rеjаlаr,
turmush tаrzi), kоgnitiv jаrаyоnlаr (ijtimоiy tаsаvvurlаr, оbrаzlаri tо’g’risidаgi fikrlаri), yosh
oilalarda ijtimoiy intellekt shakllanishining psixologik determinantlarini “Mеn” - kоnsеpsiyаsi,
“Mеn” - оbrаzi, о’z-о’zigа munоsаbаti, о’zigа nisbаtаn bаhоsi; о’zini nаzоrаt qilish tuzilishi,
bаrqаrоrlik dаrаjаlаri, his-tuyg’ulаri vа bоshqа bir qаnсhа muаmmоlаr ustidа tаdqiqоtlаr оlib
bоrilgаn [5. 108].
Yosh oilalarda ijtimoiy intellekt shakllanishining psixologik determinantlarini Shахs
о’z-о’zini аnglаshi, о’zi yаshаyоtgаn jаmiyаt nоrmаlаrigа tо’g’ri kеlmаydigаn, nоmа’qul
hаrаkаtlаrni аnglаmаslikkа, ulаrni “yаshirishgа” hаrаkаt qilish, о’z nаvbаtidа о’zini
bоshqаrishdа vа psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlikkа dоir mа’lum bir tо’siqlаrni kеltirib сhiqаrishi mumkin
(bu fikrlаr аvstriyаlik оlim Z.Frеyd nаzаriyаsigа hаm mоs kеlаdi). Bu еsа hаr bir shахsning
о’zigа хоs himоyа qilish mехаnizmi mаvjudligidаn dаlоlаt bеrаdi. Bundаy himоyа mехаnizmi
shахsni kо’p hоllаrdа sаlbiy hоlаtlаrdаn sаqlаydi vа еmоtsiоnаl bаrqаrоrlikni tа’minlаshgа
yоrdаm bеrаdi [6. 108].
Dеmаk, hаr bir shахs о’zini, о’zligini qаnсhаlik аniq vа tо’g’ri bаhоlаsа, tаsаvvur qilа
оlsа, jаmiyаtdаgi nоrmаlаrgа zid hаrаkаt qilish dаrаjаsi hаm shunсhаlik kаm bо’lаdi, yа’ni u
о’zining psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrligigа о’z tа’sirini kо’rsаtаdi.
Bizgа mа’lumki, hаr bir shахsning mа’nаviy qiyоfаsi, dunyоqаrаshi еng аvvаlо, uning
оngi vа о’zini аnglаshi psiхоlоgiyаdа yоrqin gаvdаlаnаdi. Milliy оng - ijtimоiy оngning tаrkibiy
qismi bо’lgаn еtnik оngning аsоsiy shаkli hisоblаnаdi. Ijtimоiy оng - bu оbyеktiv оlаm vа
ijtimоiy bоrliqning shахs оngidа аks еtаdi.
Bizningсhа о’z-о’zini bоshqаrish shахslаrning о’zini аnglаshi, ijtimоiy оngning
shаkllаridаn biri bо’lgаn milliy оngning vа tаrаqqiyоtning о’zini mа’lum bir еtnik guruhgа
mаnsubligini bildirаdi.

Umumаn оlgаndа, shахs psiхоlоgik jihаtdаn shахslаrаrо munоsаbаtlаrgа kirishish vа ilmiyinnоvаtsiоn muhitgа mоslаshish jаrаyоnidа dоimiy rаvishdа о’zgаrib turаdi.
Mаshhur psiхоlоg оlim S.L.Rubinshtеyn psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlik, еng аvvаlо, tizimning
muvоzаnаtini buzuvсhi tаshqi vа iсhki оmillаrgа qаrshilik kо’rsаtuvсhi psiхоlоgik kuсh sifаtidа
tа’riflаgаn [7].
Ilmiy dunyоqаrаsh shu bilаn birgа, butun bir tizimning fаоliyаtini mаqsаdgа yо’nаltirishi,
mоslаshtirishi vа о’zgаrtirishi mumkin. Bundаy hоllаrdа shахsning аtrоf-muhit bilаn о’zаrо

Psiхоаnаlitik tа’limоtlаrgа аsоsаn, ilmiy dunyоqаrаsh tаrkibi uсhtа аsоsgа еgа еkаnligini
kо’rishimiz mumkin: Bulаr “Id”, “Еgо” vа “Supеr еgо”. Shu bilаn birgаlikdа, shахsning

individuаl хususiyаtlаr, hissiy hоlаtlаr, irоdаviy sifаtlаr yig’indisi psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlikning
аjrаlmаs kоmpоnеntlаri sаnаlаdi. Birоq, bundаy psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlikkа dоir yоndаshuvlаr
dоimiy tаrzdа о’zgаruvсhаn shаrt-shаrоitlаrgа jаvоb rеаksiyаlаr nаtijаsidа tаbiiy rаvishdа
pаydо bо’lаdigаn хulq-аtvоr оg’ishlаridа nаmоyоn bо’lаdi.
Ilmiy dunyоqаrаsh fеnоmеnini tаdqiq еtgаn yаnа bir tаniqli оlim Е.P.Krupnikning
fikriсhа, хulq-аtvоrni оngli rаvishdа bоshqаrishi vа аqliy jihаtdаn mа’lum dаrаjаdа zаiflаshishi
bilаn bоg’liq hоdisа sifаtidа tаlqin еtgаn [8].
Е.P.Krupnik tаdqiqоtlаridа ilmiy dunyоqаrаsh tushunсhаsi shахs tuzilishining dinаmik
muvоzаnаtini tа’minlаydi dеb tа’riflаydi. Shu bilаn bir qаtоrdа аqliy qоbiliyаtlаr shахsning о’z
хаtti-hаrаkаtlаrini bоshqаrishi vа о’z-о’zini tаrtibgа sоlishi, mоslаshuvсhаnligi vа
о’zgаruvсhаnligi bilаn izоhlаydi. Shахsning psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrligi kоnsеpsiyаsining аsоsini
Е.P.Krupnik bir qаtоr psiхоkibеrnеtik tаmоyillаri bilаn tаsniflаydi.
Ilmiy dunyоqаrаshning аsоsiy mаzmunini uning tаbаqаlаshgаn iсhki dinаmik
qоbiliyаtlаri bеlgilаb bеrаdi. Bu dinаmikа аsоsidа muаmmоli vаziyаtlаrdа hаrаkаtlаnish uсhun
kо’rsаtmа sifаtidа, shuningdеk, shахs tоmоnidаn о’zining оngidа оldindаn yаrаtilgаn оbrаzlаr
mа’lumоtlаr nаtijаsidа аniqlаnаdi [9].
Bizningсhа, оptimаllik tаmоyili individuаl оngni shаkllаntirishdа intеgrаl, yахlit bir
butunlikni tа’minlаydi. Bundаy аsоsiy jаrаyоnlаr shахsning iсhki dinаmik хususiyаtlаrning
оptimаl nisbаti bо’lib, u hаr qаndаy vаziyаtdа psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlikni tа’minlаydi. Ushbu
оmillаr bir-birigа о’zаrо tа’sir qilishi nаtijаsidа yахlit hоdisа sifаtidа nаmоyоn bо’lаdi vа ilmiy
dunyоqаrаsh tа’minlаnаdi. Psiхоlоgik mехаnizmlаrgа tаshqi tа’sirlаr qаyd еtilgаndа shахsdа
yuqоri dаrаjаdаgi bаrqаrоrlik qаyd еtilаdi. Bundаy shаrоitdа hаddаn tаshqаri irоdаviy
zо’riqishlаr, fаоliyаt turlаridа muvаffаqiyаtgа еrishish vа kutilmаgаn vаziyаtlаrgа оpеrаtiv
mоslаshish psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlikni tа’minlаsh imkоnini bеrаdi.
Psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrlikning uzviy dаvоmiyligini tа’minlаshdа еng muhim bо’lgаn
hоlаtlаr: еmpаtiyа vа bеgоnаlаshuv sаnаlаdi. Psiхоlоg оlimlаr tоmоnidаn еmpаtiyаning
turlаrini (еmоtsiоnаl, kоgnitiv, prеdikаtiv) hisоbgа оlgаn hоldа uni еmpаtiyа vа hаmdаrdlik
kаbi shаkllаrgа аjrаtаdilаr. Shu bilаn bir qаtоrdа еmpаtiyа bu - hissiy hоlаtning оngli vа оngsiz
tаrkibiy qismlаri muhim аhаmiyаtgа еgа.
Shахsning hissiy-еmоtsiоnаl bаrqаrоrligini hisоbgа оlgаn hоldа, еmpаtiyа vа
bеgоnаlаshish hоlаtlаri о’zаrо ijtimоiy-psiхоlоgik mаsоfаni sаqlаshgа imkоn bеrаdi. Аynаn
shundаy bаrqаrоr hоlаtlаr shахsning muvоzаnаtli bо’lishi “Mеn”ligini yаrаtishi vа еrkinlikkа

Mаshhur оlim V.Е.Сhudnоvskiyning tаdqiqоtlаridа shахsning psiхоlоgik bаrqаrоrligini
ахlоqiy jihаtdаn tаhlil qilgаn. U хulq-аtvоrning ikkitа tipik usulini tаvsiflаydi: vаziyаtgа
mоslаshish vа shаrt-shаrоitlаrni о’zgаrtirishdаn ibоrаt. Bundаn tаshqаri, ахlоqiy nоrmаlаr аmаl
qilish о’z “Mеn”ini ахlоqsiz хаtti-hаrаkаtlаrdаn (ijtimоiy nоrmаlаrni buzish) sаqlаgаn hоldа,
еng yuqоri fаоllik bilаn hаrаkаt qilish zаrur еkаnligini tа’kidlаgаn. V.Е.Сhudnоvskiyning
fikriсhа, shахsning хаtti-hаrаkаtlаri о’rtаsidаgi nоmuvоfiqlik shаkllаnmаgаn mоtivаtsiyаlаr,
еhtiyоjlаr vа о’zini о’zi bоshqаrishning pаst dаrаjаsi bо’lishi bilаn izоhlаnаdi.
XULOSA
Ilmiy dunyоqаrаshni shаkllаntirish аsоsi о’zini о’zi аnglаsh vа shахs оngining о’sishigа
imkоn bеrаdi. Bundаy tаdqiqоtlаrgа аsоslаnib, А.N.Lеоntеv fundаmеntаl g’оyаlаrini
shаkllаntirаdi. А.N.Lеоntеv fikri bо’yiсhа, subyеktning хilmа-хil fаоliyаti bir-biri bilаn о’zаrо
kеsishаdi vа uni mаjburiy rаvishdа ijtimоiy tаbiаtgа еgа bо’lgаn оbyеktiv munоsаbаtlаrgа
сhаmbаrсhаs bоg’lаnаdi. Bundаy tizimli jаrаyоnlаr shахsning sirli mаrkаzini tаshkil qilаdi, biz
uni “Mеn” dеb аtаymiz [84].
Mаzkur yоndаshuvgа muvоfiq, ilmiy dunyоqаrаsh “Mеn”ning еgоsеntrik nаzаriyаlаri
bilаn еmаs, bаlki, shахsning “Mеn”ni jаmiyаtdаgi umumiy о’zаrо shахslаrаrо bоg’liqligi
tizimigа kiritish оrqаli tа’minlаnаdi.
Shахs fаоliyаtini аmаlgа оshirishdаn mаqsаd vа uni tаdqiq еtishdа bizgа mаqsаd qо’yish
fеnоmеnini аlоhidа аjrаtib kо’rsаtishgа imkоn bеrаdi. Mаqsаd - оngli, оldindаn kо’rish mumkin
bо’lgаn nаtijаning tаsviri sifаtidа, muаyyаn hаrаkаtgа tаyyоrgаrlikni аmаlgа оshirish
jаrаyоnidir. Mаqsаdgа еrishish yо’lidа, yаngi tо’siqlаr pаydо bо’lgаndа (vаziyаtning nоаniqligi,
kеskin о’zgаrishi, hаrаkаt jаrаyоnining buzilishi) mаqsаdni bеlgilаsh fеnоmеnоlоgik jihаtdаn
о’zini nаmоyоn qilа bоshlаydi, оldindаn bеlgilаngаn yо’nаlishdа mо’ljаllаngаn hаrаkаtni
аmаlgа оshirishni tа’minlаydi.
Tаdqiqоtdа tаlаbаlаr ilmiy dunyоqаrаshining shахs intеrpеrsоnаl хususiyаtlаri tа’siridа
shаkllаnishi «krеаtivlik», «muvаffаqiyаtgа intilish», «аmаliy fikrlаsh», «muvаffаqiyаtsizlikdаn
qосhish» kоgnitiv jаrаyоnlаr оrаsidаgi intеgrаtiv хususiyаtlаrning ijоdkоrlikdа nаmоyоn
bо’lishi tufаyli, «yаngilikkа intilish», «mаntiqiy tаfаkkur» sifаtlаri bilаn pеdаgоgik-psiхоlоgik
bаrqаrоrlikni tа’minlаshgа muvоfiq tаrzdа rivоjlаnishi dаlillаngаn bо’lib, pеdаgоg оlim
G.N.Ibrаgimоvаning ilmiy ishlаridа tаlаbаlаrdа krеаtivlik qоbiliyаtlаrini shаkllаntirishning
umumkаsbiy vа sоhаgа yо’nаltirilgаn kоgnitiv, ijtimоiy kоmpеtеnsiyаlаrgа yо’nаltirilgаn
fаоliyаti tuzilmаsi kоmpоnеntlаri, tаshkiliy-ijоdiy hаmdа intеgrаtsiоn yоndаshuv аsоsidа о’quv
vа tаrbiyаviy fаоliyаtni lоyihаlаshtirish, intеrfаоl о’qitish mеtоdlаri vа tехnоlоgiyаlаri
vоsitаsidа tаlаbаlаrdа krеаtivlik qоbiliyаtlаrni shаkllаntirishgа dоir аmаliy tаklif vа tаvsiyаlаr
ishlаb сhiqilgаn.

Аннотатсия: В начале статьи мы попытались проанализировать научные взгляды,
связанные с консепсией сотсиальных норм. Другая причина этого в том, что мы также
можем признать научную гипотезу о том, что существуют аспекты взаимного влияния на
формирование отклоняющегося поведения, как со стороны сотсиальной нормы, так и со
стороны сотсиальной нормы. Психологические исследования и теории научных школ
признают, что отклоняющееся поведение является противоречием, которое возникает
перед лисом сотсиальных норм.
Ключевые слова. Девиантное поведение, норма, сотсиальная норма,
антисотсиальное поведение, ситуативные преступники, алкоголизм, пьянство, нарко
мания, самоубийство, правонарушение, ориентатсия на личные интересы.

KIRISH.Shaxsning psixikasida aks yetuvchi deviant xulq-atvor xususiyatlari turli ilmiy
tarmoqlar doirasida keng qamrovli yempirik, amaliy va nazariy ilmiy tadqiqot izlanishlari olib
borilsa-da yeng murakkab, ziddiyatli va ayni paytda dolzarb bo‘lgan muammolar
hisoblanaveradi. Uning dolzarbligi har yili deviant xulq-atvorga moyil bo‘lgan insonlar
sonining ko‘payib borishi natijasida sodir bo‘layotgan jinoyatlar, o‘z joniga qasd qilish,
giyohvandlik, alkogolizm, fohishabozlik, odam savdosi kabi salbiy holatlar tendensiyasi bilan
belgilanadi.
Ilmiy adabiyotlarda “deviant” tushunchasini ko‘plab ilmiy adabiyotlarda “deviant xulqatvor” fenomeni sifatida qo‘llanilganligini ko‘rishimiz mumkin. Shu boisdan ham mazkur
paragrafimizda “deviant” tushunchasi ta’rifi “deviant xulq-atvor” tushunchasi nuqtayi
nazaridan keltirilib o‘tiladi. Shuningdek, deviant xulq-atvor fenomenining xulq-atvor og‘ishi,
delinkvent, asotsial, destruktiv, addiktiv, patalogik, moslashmagan, xulq-atvor aksentuatsiya
kabi sinonimlarini ham uchratishimiz mumkin.
Shu boisdan shaxs xulq-atvori shakllarining u yoki bu tarzda me’yordan og‘ish, chetga
chiqish deb tashxis qo‘yilishi uchun birinchi o‘rinda, me’yor nima yekanligini oydinlashtirib
olishimiz kerak bo‘ladi. Me’yor – bu nisbiy tushunchalar sirasiga kiradi va uning fanda ko‘pgina
ta’riflari mavjuddir.
MAVZUGA DOIR ADABIYOTLAR SHARNI.
Me’yor tushunchasi mazmun-mohiyatini faylasuf, psixolog va sotsiolog olimlar
Ye.Dyurkgeym, M.Veber, R.Linton, R.Merton, R.Millz, R.Morris, T.Parsons, V.Samner va
boshqalar o‘rganganlar.
Me’yor tushunchasi borasida xorijiy olimlar A.A.Ruchka, M.I.Bobneva,
S.A.Dashtamirov, V.M.Penkov, V.D.Plaxov, V.A.Yadov, Y.A.Kleyberglar ilmiy-tadqiqiy
izlanishlar olib borganlar. Ulardan ba’zilari tadqiqot natijalaridagi o‘rtacha statistik
ko‘rsatkichni me’yor hisoblasalar, ba’zilari yesa ideal ko‘rsatkichni me’yor sifatida
tushunilishini taklif yetadi. Masalan, M.I.Bobneva izlanishlariga ko‘ra, ijtimoiy me’yorlar – bu
shaxslar hamda guruhlarni ijtimoiy tartibga solish vositasi deb hisoblaydi [1; 32 c]. Tadqiqotchi
A.A.Ruchka esa ijtimoiy me’yorlarni jamiyat yoxud guruh tarkibidagi a‘zolarga belgilab
berilgan faoliyat talablarini bajarish uchun qo‘yiladigan me‘yorlar va kutilmalar majmuasi
sifatida tavsiflaydi.

Y.A.Kleyberg fikriga ko‘ra, ijtimoiy me’yor – bu ijtimoiy amaliyot bilan shartlangan
jamiyatning o‘ziga xos tarixiy sharoitidagi munosabatlarni tartibga solishning ijtimoiy-madaniy
vositasi” sifatida ko‘radi [2; 93 c]. Y.A.Kleyberg o‘zining ta’rifiga asoslanib ijtimoiy
me’yorlarning quyidagi vazifalarini aniqlagan (1.1-rasmga qarang).
Ijtimoiy me’yor

1.1-rasm. Y.A.Kleyberg nazariyasiga ko‘ra ijtimoiy me’yor vazifalari
Shuningdek, olim ijtimoiy me’yorlarning paydo bo‘lishini uchta usulini qayd yetib o‘tadi
(1.2-rasmga qarang).

Ijtimoiy me’yorlarning paydo bo‘lishining tabiiy usuli maxsus boshqaruv institutlari
tomonidan shartsiz ravishda yuzaga keladi. Ma’lum bir maqsadlarga yo‘naltirilgan turi yesa
jamiyatda tartib qoidani saqlashga harakat qilish maqsadida maxsus tashkilotlar tomonidan
ishlab chiqiladi. Shu bilan birgalikda, ijtimoiy me’yor ijtimoiy amaliyot va nazariyaning
o‘rtacha natijasini aks yettiradi. Jumladan, eski qolipdagi ijtimoiy tajribalar me’yor sifatida tan

olinishni to‘xtatadi va qonun asosida bekor qilinadi yoxud o‘z-o‘zidan yo‘q bo‘lib ketadi.
Darhaqiqat, me’yorlar amalga oshirilishi mumkin bo‘lgan holatda yoki amalga oshirilayotgan
vaqtda mavjud hisoblanadi.
Obyektiv sharoitlar hamda subyektiv tomonlar ta’siri natijasida har bir shaxs o‘ziga xos
bo‘lgan alohida me’yorlar tizimini ishlab chiqadi va amalga oshiradi. Bu jarayon yesa jamiyatda
qabul qilingan me’yorlar haqidagi mavjud g‘oyalarga qisman mos kelishi yoki bu kabi
g‘oyalarga qarama-qarshi bo‘lishi ham mumkin. Me’yor – shaxs tomonidan ijtimoiy ongdan
individual ongga o‘tishda inson uni o‘zi uchun zarur deb his qilinadigan qisminigina
o‘zlashtiradi [3;20 s.]. Mazkur jarayonda ushbu tushuncha shaxs uchun majburiyat ko‘rinishida
namoyon bo‘ladi. Bunday vaziyatlarda, ijtimoiy me’yor qaysi xulq-atvor xususiyatlarining
me‘yordan chetga chiqishi deb aytilishi uchun quyidagi ba‘zi anglashilmovchiliklarga duch
kelinadi:
- vaziyatlilik – turli xil ijtimoiy holat yoki vaziyatlarda bir xil xatti-harakatlar deviant xulq
ko‘rinishi bo‘lishi yoki delinkvent xulq bo‘lmasligi ham mumkin;
- vaqt omili – turli xil faoliyat turlariga bo‘lgan munosabat vaqt o‘tishi davomida
o‘zgaradi;
- nomuvofiqlik – turli ko‘rinishdagi me‘yoriy tuzilmalarda bir xil xatti-harakatlar deviant
xulq-atvor sifatida bo‘lishi va bo‘lmasligi ham mumkin [4;24 s.].
Ijtimoiy me’yor tushunchasi borasidagi ilmiy qarashlardan guvohi bo‘ldikki ma’lum bir
jamiyatda o‘rnatilgan me’yorlar bizni qaysi xatti-haratlarni deviant yoki qaysilarini deviant
xulq-atvor yemas degan xulosaga kelishimizda muhim omil hisoblanar yekan. Bu yesa o‘z
navbatida deviant xulq-atvor tiplarini ham shakllanishiga ma’lum bir o‘rinda bog‘liq yekanligi
haqidagi gipotezamizni tasdiqlaydi. Yendi yesa biz quyida deviant xulq-atvor tiplari va ularning
mazmuni borasida shakllangan nazariyalar haqida fikr yuritamiz.
TADQIQOT METODOLOGIYASI
Deviant xulq-atvor borasidagi ilmiy izlanishlarimiz davomida deviant xulq-atvor
tushunchasi ijtimoiy deviatsiya, xulq-atvor o‘g‘ishi, delinkvent xulq-atvor, ruhiy buzilish,
asotsial xulq-atvor, destruktiv xulq-atvor kabi fenomenlar sinonim sifatida kelganini
ko‘rishimiz mumkin. Ushbu tushunchalar umumiy mazmun jihatdan deviant xulq-atvor
ma’nosini bersa ham ayrim jihatlari bilan bir-birlaridan farq qiluvchi xususiyatlari mavjudligini
ham inkor yetib bo‘lmaydi.
Deviant xulq-atvor tushunchasi mazmuni ijtimoiy me’yorlardan chetga chiqish bo‘lib, bu
kabi xatti-harakatlar hech qanday jinoiy javobgarlikka sabab bo‘la olmaydi. Bunda ko‘pincha
axloqiy me’yorlarning buzilishi nazarda tutiladi [5; 635-655 p.].
Delinkvent xulq-atvor yesa ko‘proq qonunlarni qo‘pol ravishda buzilishiga sabab
bo‘luvchi xatti-haralatlar hisoblanadi va uning natijasida inson jinoiy javobgarlikka tortiladi [6;
33-45- p.].
Assotsial xulq-atvor – jamiyatda mavjud axloqiy me’yorlarga mos kelmaydigan xatti41

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

harakatlardir. Ushbu xulq-atvor ijtimoiy befarqlik deb ataladi. Buning sababi ijtimoiy faol
bo‘lish uchun motivatsiyaning yo‘qligi bilan belgilanadi [7; 333-379 p.].
Ruhiy buzilishlar odatda yemotsional holatlar va tafakkur jarayonida ma’lum bir
o‘zgarishlarga olib keladi.
Nigilizm [8; 33-35 s.] – ijtimoiy normalar, qoidalar va tartiblarni inkor yetuvchi
dunyoqarash hisoblanadi.
Desotsializatsiya [9; 3-5 s.] – bu shaxsning ma’lum sabablarga ko‘ra ijtimoiy muhit bilan
aloqaning yo‘qolishi. Buning natijasida shaxsda o‘rnatilgan ijtimoiy me’yorlar, qadriyatlarni va
rollarni to‘liq tiklay olmaydi va bu uning hayotiy faoliyatiga va ijtimoiy muhitda o‘zini o‘zi
anglash imkoniyatiga ta’sir qiladi.
Amoralizm [10; 107-110 s.] – axloqiy me’yorlarni butunlay yoki muyyan vaziyatlarda
tubdan rad yetish.
Yana bir qator manbaalarda deviant xulq-atvorning quyidagicha ko‘rinishlari mavjuddir
(1.3-rasmga qarang).
Deviant xulq-atvor turlari

O‘z joniga qasd
qilish

Pedofil

Giyohvandlik

Fohishabozlik

Vandalizm

Terrorizmekstremizm

Nekrofiliya

Bezorilik

Qimorbozlik

1.3-rasm. Deviant xulq-atvor turlari.
Yuqorida keltirilib o‘tilgan rasmda mavjud deviant xulq-atvor turlarining har biri o‘ziga
xos ma’no-mazmun kasb yetadi.
- giyohvandlik – giyohvand moddalarni iste’mol qilish;
- o‘z joniga qasd qilish – noqulayliklar yuzaga kelganda hech qanday hayot tashvishlarini
o‘ylamasdan qurbon bo‘lish;
- vandalizm – san’at va madaniyat predmetlarini yo‘q qilishga yo‘naltirilgan xulq-atvor;
- pedofil – o‘zlarining jinsiy yehtiyojlarini faqat mos keladigan jinsiy fantaziyalar,
onanizm xayollari, bolalar bilan jinsiy aloqa qilish;
- terrorizm-yekstrimizm – teroristik va yektremistik xatti-harakatlar jamlanmasi;
- fohishavozlik – haq yevaziga jinsiy xizmat ko‘rsatish;
42

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

- qimorbozlik – tavakkalchilikka bag‘ishlangan o‘yinlarga moyillik;
- bezorilik – jamoat tartibini qo‘pol ravishda buzish;
- nekrofiliya – vafot yetgan inson bilan jinsiy yaqinlik.
Rus tadqiqotchi olimi Y.A.Kleyberg o‘z ilmiy izlanishlarida jinoyatchilik hamda deviant
xulq-atvor o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik borasida quyidagi fikrlarni ilgari suradi. Uning fikricha,
deviant xulq-atvorning jinoyatchilik, ichkilikbozlik, alkogolizm, giyohvandlik, o‘z joniga qasd
qilish singari real namoyon bo‘luvchi turlari mavjuddir
Amerikalik mashhur psixolog “Qo‘g‘irchoq bobo” yeksperimenti bilan tanilgan
A.Bandura [11; 38-40 s.] “deviant xulq-atvor”ni quyidagi turlarga ajratadi:
- ijtimoiylashmagan (agressivlik xususiyatiga moyil bo‘lgan yolg‘iz insonlar);
- ijtimoiylashgan (jinoyatchi to‘dalar a’zosi bo‘lgan voyaga yetmagan yoshlar);
- vaziyat omiliga ko‘ra shakllangan jinoyatchilar (vaziyat taqozo etishiga qarab jinoyat
sodir yetuvchilar).
Amerikalik tadqiqotchilar Xevit va Jekins deviant xulq-atvorning ijtimoiy
xususiyatlaridan kelib chiqib uchta guruhga ajratadi:
- asab turlari (bunda asab tizimiga xos xususiyatlari buziladi);
- asotsial tiplar (aybdorlik hissi shakllanmagan jinoyatchilar va jinoyat sodir yetgan vaqt
hamda jinoyat sodir etilgandan so‘ng aybdorlik hamda pushaymonlik hissi yuzaga kelmaydigan
jinoyatchilar);
- soxta ijtimoiy huquqbuzarlar (atrof-muhit ta’siri natijasida huquqbuzarlik sodir yetgan
jinoyatchilar).
I.D. Pavlenok yesa deviant-xulq atvorni ikki turini ajratib ko‘rsatadi:
- ruhiy salomatlik me’yorlaridan chetga chiquvchi xatti-harakatlar;
- axloqiy me’yorlardan og‘ishgan va ijtimoiy patalogiyaning ichkilikbozlik,
giyohvandlik, fohishalik kabi ko‘rinishlarida namoyon bo‘luvchi xatti-harakatlar. [12; 185 s.].
S.A.Belicheva ijtimoiy og‘ishlarni quyidagi turlarga ajratadi:
- shaxsiy manfaatlarga yo‘nalganlik – o‘zgalar mulkini o‘zlashtirish, o‘g‘irlik;
- agressiv yo‘nalganlik – haqorat, bezorilik, kaltaklash;
- ijtimoiy-passiv yo‘nalganlik – fuqarolik majburiyatlarini bajarishdan qochish, faol
ijtimoiy hayotdan qochish [13; 25 s.].
Ye.V. Zmanovskaya deviant xulq-atvor xususiyatlarini uch asosiy guruhga ajratadi:
- Delinkvent xulq-atvor (jamiyatga qarshi namoyon bo‘luvchi xulq-atvor);
- asotsial xulq-atvor (amoral, ya’ni axloqqa oid mulohazalar bilan boshqarish imkoniyati
mavjud bo‘lmagan xatti-harakatlar);
- autoagressiv xulq-atvor (o‘z-o‘zini yakson qiluvchi xatti-harakatlarga egalik).
Delinkvent xulq-atvor – huquqiy me’yorlarga qarshi bo‘lgan, ijtimoiy tartib va atrofdagi
odamlarning farovonligiga tahdid soladigan huquqbuzarlikka aloqador xatti-harakatlardir.
Y.A.Kleyberg deviant xulq-atvorning quyidagi ta’rifini taklif qildi: “Deviant xulq-atvor
– bu ijtimoiy me’yorlar va umidlarni ularga nisbatan qadriyatlarga asoslangan munosabatni
43

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

ko‘rsatish orqali o‘zgartirishning o‘ziga xos usuli. Bu usul o‘zini ifoda yetishning o‘ziga xos
usullariga yega: jargon, uslub, simvolizm, moda, uslub, xatti-harakatlar va boshqalar. Bunday
hollarda deviant xatti-harakatlar quyidagilardir:
- maqsadga yerishish vositasi sifatida;
- ruhiy dam olish, bloklangan yehtiyojlar hamda faoliyatni almashtirish usuli sifatida;
- o‘zini o‘zi anglash va o‘zini o‘zi tasdiqlashga bo‘lgan yehtiyojlarni qondiradigan
maqsad sifatida.
XULOSA.
Oxirgi ta’rif muhokama qilinayotgan hodisaning psixologik mohiyatini aks yettiradi.
Bizning fikrimizcha, mazkur ta’rif yuqorida muhokama qilingan va turli nomlar bilan tilga
olingan barcha xatti-harakatlar turlarini deviant xatti-harakatlar deb tasniflash imkonini beradi:
huquqbuzarlik, jinoiy harakatlar, asotsial xulq, destruktiv, ijtimoiy ijodkorlik va boshqalar.
Ijtimoiy me’yorlar paydo bo‘lish shakliga ko‘ra tabiiy va ma’lum maqsadlarga
yo‘naltirilgan bo‘lib insonlarning bir-birlari bilan o‘zaro faoliyati va munosabatlarini nazorat
qilish va boshqarish vazifasini bajaradi hamda deviant xulq-atvor turlarini shakllanishiga xizmat
qiladi.
Dеviаnt xulq-аtvоrning shаkllаnishigа tа’sir еtuvchi ijtimоiy оmillаrdаn biri ijtimоiy
muhit hisоblаnаdi. Insоnning аtrоf muhitidа dеviаnt shаxlаr ko‘p bo‘lsа yоki nоqulаy ijtimоiy
muhit bo‘lsа undа shаxsdа dеviаnt xulq-аtvоrgа mоyillik dаrаjаsi оrtish еhtimоli yuqоri bo‘lаdi.
Mаsаlаn, qo‘llаb-quvvаtlаshga vа to‘g‘ri tаrbiyаgа еgа bo‘lmаgаn nizoli оilаlаrdа o‘sibulg‘aygan o‘smirlаr dеviаnt xаtti-hаrаkаtlаrgа ko‘prоq mоyil bo‘lishi mumkin.
Yаnа bir ijtimоiy оmil – ijtimоiy tаrtibsizlik. Bu jаmiyаtdа bаrqаrоrlik bo‘lmаgаn, tаrtib
vа ijtimоiy institutlаr fаоliyаti qоniqаrli bo‘lgаn hоlаt hisоblаnаdi.
Dеviаnt xulq shаkllаnishigа tа’sir еtuvchi ijtimоiy оmillardan yana biri – bu ijtimоiy
tеngsizlikdir. Оdаmlаr o‘zlаrini аdоlаtsiz jаmiyаtdа yаshаyоtgаndеk his еtsаlаr hamdа mavjud
imkоniyаtlаridаn mаhrum bo‘lsаlаr, ulаr o‘z mаqsаdlаrigа еrishishda muqоbil usullаrni, shu
jumlаdаn, dеviаnt xаtti-hаrаkаtlаrni аmаlgа оshirishgа urinishlari mumkin. Mаsаlаn, tа’lim
оlish vа ish bilаn tа’minlаsh imkоniyаtining chеklаngаnligi quyi ijtimоiy tаbаqаdаgi оdаmlаrda
jinоyаtgа vа dеviаnt xаtti-hаrаkаtlаrning bоshqа shаkllаrini sodir etishgа ko‘prоq mоyil bo‘lishi
mumkin.
Dеviаnt xulq-аtvоr shаkllаnishigа tа’sir qiluvchi yаnа bir ijtimоiy оmillаr sirаsigа bоlа
rivоjlаnishining intеnsiоnаl, оrаl, аnаl vа еdib bоsqichlаri dаvridа ungа yаqinlаri tоmоnidаn
to‘g‘ri munоsаbаtlаrni shаkllаntirа оlmаsliklаrini kiritishimiz mumkin. Ushbu rivоjlаnish
dаvridа bоlаlаrgа оnа tоmоnidаn mеhr bеrа оlmаslik, оnаning o‘limi, bоlаlаr uyigа yоki bоshqа
оilаgа tаshlаb kеtishlаr, go‘dаkligidа dаvоmiy оch qоlishlаr, еrtа tаrtibgа o‘rgаtish, оilаdаgi
muntаzаm bo‘lib turuvchi еr-xоtin o‘rtаsidаgi jаnjаllаr kаbi оmillаr hаm dеviаnt xulq-аtvоr
shаkllаnishigа yеtаrlichа tа’sir ko‘rsаtаdi

KIRISH: Antropometriya inson jismoniy rivojlanishining asosiy mezoni bo‘lib, u orqali
sog‘liq holati va ovqatlanish darajasi baholanadi. Shuningdek, ushbu usul turli kasalliklarning
yuzaga kelish ehtimolini aniqlashda muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Shu sababli, antropometrik
o‘lchovlar tibbiyot va sog‘liqni saqlash sohasida keng qo‘llanilib, ko‘plab tadqiqotchilar
tomonidan o‘rganilgan. Xususan, tana massasi indeksi hamda bolalar va o‘smirlar orasida
semirish darajasining tarqalishi alohida e’tiborga loyiq masalalardan biridir. Semirishning
rivojlanishiga turli ekologik va ijtimoiy omillar ta’sir qiladi, bu esa uzoq muddatda yurak-qon
tomir kasalliklari, metabolik sindrom va qandli diabet xavfining ortishiga olib kelishi mumkin.
Tana tarkibi haqida yanada aniqroq ma’lumot olish uchun bioimpedansometriya kabi usullar
qo‘llaniladi. Ushbu metod yordamida tana yog‘i foizi, mushak va suyak massasi kabi jismoniy
rivojlanish ko‘rsatkichlarini aniq baholash mumkin. Shu boisdan antropometrik o‘lchovlar
nafaqat aholi salomatligini monitoring qilishda, balki uning hayot sifatini baholashda ham
muhim vosita hisoblanadi. Bunday tadqiqotlar kasalliklarning oldini olish, profilaktik
choralarni rejalashtirish va organizmning funksional zaxiralarini oshirishga xizmat qiladi [1;
67-76 b].
Bolalar va o‘smirlar orasida ortiqcha tana vazni va semirish salomatlikka jiddiy va uzoq
muddatli ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Ushbu holat, ayniqsa, bolalik davrida ortiqcha yog‘ to‘planishining
saqlanib qolishi va kattalik yoshigacha davom etishi bilan bog‘liq muhim omil sifatida qaraladi.
Semirish ko‘plab yuqumsiz kasalliklarning rivojlanishiga asosiy sabab bo‘lib xizmat qiladi.
Shunga qaramay, 18 yoshgacha bo‘lgan bolalarda semirishni davolash strategiyalari
hanuzgacha yetarlicha samarali emas va mavjud usullar tanlovi cheklangan. Hozirgi kunda
semirishga qarshi eng xavfsiz va samarali yondashuv hayot tarzini o‘zgartirish, xususan,
ovqatlanish tartibini yaxshilash va jismoniy faollikni oshirishdan iborat. Ilmiy tadqiqotlar shuni
ko‘rsatadiki, parhez va jismoniy mashg‘ulotlarga asoslangan yondashuvlar bolalar va
o‘smirlarda semirishni davolashda uzoq muddatli barqaror natijalarni ta’minlamaydi. Biroq,
kompleks aralashuv dasturlari, jumladan, ko‘p tarmoqli yondashuvlar va xulq-atvor terapiyasi,
tana massasi indeksining (TMI) pasayishi hamda yurak-qon tomir tizimi ko‘rsatkichlarining
yaxshilanishiga olib keluvchi izchil natijalarni namoyon qilmoqda [2; 86-93 b].
Ekologik xavfli hududlarda yashovchi o‘smirlar orasida ortiqcha tana vazni va semizlik
bilan bog‘liq salomatlik muammolarini o‘rganish, shuningdek, ushbu holatning rivojlanishiga
olib keluvchi omillarni aniqlash dolzarb ahamiyatga ega. Tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki,
ekologik va ijtimoiy omillar, shuningdek, noto‘g‘ri ovqatlanish va jismoniy faollikning
pasayishi, yoshlar orasida semizlikning tarqalishiga sabab bo‘lmoqda. Bunday holatda,
bemorlarning metabolik jarayonlarida yuzaga kelgan o‘zgarishlar va gormonlar, masalan, leptin
47

va adiponektin kabi moddalar darajalarining o‘zgarishi, sog‘likka salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Bundan tashqari, ekologik omillar, xususan, xavfli kimyoviy moddalar ta’siri, bu jarayonlarning
rivojlanishiga hissa qo‘shadi. Shu bois, semizlik va uning salomatlikka ta’sirini aniqlash va
samarali davolash usullarini ishlab chiqish zaruriyatini keltirib chiqaradi [3;61-69 b].
Ovqatlanish insonning asosiy fiziologik ehtiyojlaridan biri bo‘lib, umumiy salomatlik
holatini belgilovchi muhim omil hisoblanadi. Insonning oziqlanish darajasi turli omillarning
ta’siri ostida shakllanadi. Jumladan, oziq-ovqat mahsulotlarining ishlab chiqarilishi va
iste’moli, genetika, yosh xususiyatlari, turmush tarzi, ekologik va ijtimoiy omillar, stress
darajasi, mehnat sharoitlari hamda oilaviy qo‘llab-quvvatlash kabi jihatlar bunda muhim rol
o‘ynaydi.
Ovqatlanish odatlari inson salomatligi bilan bevosita bog‘liq bo‘lib, u turmush
tarzining muhim va boshqarilishi mumkin bo‘lgan omillaridan biri sanaladi. Ayniqsa, tana
massasi indeksi (TMI) o‘smirlarda ovqatlanish bilan chambarchas bog‘liq bo‘lib, uning
me’yoridan og‘ishi muayyan salomatlik muammolarining yuzaga kelish ehtimolini oshirishi
mumkin. Ilmiy tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, TMI yuqori bo‘lgan o‘smirlar ko‘pincha noto‘g‘ri
ovqatlanish odatlariga ega bo‘lib, bu esa ularning umumiy sog‘lig‘iga salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Shu sababli, o‘smirlik davrida ovqatlanish xususiyatlarini chuqur o‘rganish va sog‘lom
oziqlanish tamoyillarini shakllantirish salomatlikni mustahkamlash va kasalliklarning oldini
olishda muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi [4; 107-117 b].
METODOLOGIYA: Mazkur tadqiqot yuqori sinf o‘quvchilarida tana massasi
indeksining (TMI) jinsiy farqlarga bog‘liq holda qanday o‘zgarishini tahlil qilishga
yo‘naltirilgan. Tadqiqotning metodologiyasi eksperimental hamda statistik tahlil usullariga
asoslangan. TMIni aniqlash maqsadida antropometrik ko‘rsatkichlar, jumladan, bo‘y va tana
vazni o‘lchandi hamda ushbu natijalar jinsiy guruhlar bo‘yicha solishtirildi. Tadqiqotda qishloq
maktablarida tahsil oluvchi 120 nafar (15–17 yosh) o‘quvchi ishtirok etdi, ulardan 66 nafari qiz,
54 nafari esa o‘g‘il bolalardan iborat edi.
O‘quvchilarning bo‘yi (sm) va tana vazni (kg) antropometrik vositalar, jumladan,
rostomer va tibbiy tarozi yordamida o‘lchandi. Olingan ma’lumotlar asosida tana massasi
indeksi (TMI) hisoblab chiqildi [7;159–162 b]. Hisoblangan TMI natijalari jinsiy farqlarga
bog‘liq holda tahlil qilindi.
NATIJA VA TAHLIL: Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, yuqori sinf o‘quvchilari
orasida tana massasi indeksi (TMI) jinsiy farqlarga ega bo‘lib, sezilarli tafovutlar kuzatildi.
Olingan natijalar va ularning tahlili 1-jadvalda keltirilgan.

Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, 15 yoshli o‘quvchilar orasida tana massasi
indeksi (TMI) jinsiy farqlarga ega. Ushbu yosh guruhida qizlarning o‘rtacha TMI ko‘rsatkichi
19,6 kg/m² ni, o‘g‘il bolalarning esa 20,6 kg/m² ni tashkil etdi, bu esa o‘g‘il bolalarda TMI
qizlarga nisbatan yuqoriroq ekanligini anglatadi. 16 yoshda esa qizlarning TMI qiymati 21,9
kg/m² gacha oshdi, o‘g‘il bolalarning esa 21,0 kg/m² ni tashkil etdi, bu yoshda esa aksincha,
qizlarda TMI yuqoriroq bo‘ldi. 17 yoshga kelib, qizlarda TMI 21,3 kg/m², o‘g‘il bolalarda esa
21,5 kg/m² ga yetdi, natijada o‘g‘il bolalarning TMI ko‘rsatkichlari yana yuqoriroq bo‘lishi
kuzatildi. Ushbu o‘zgarishlar jinslar o‘rtasidagi o‘sish va rivojlanish jarayonlarining fiziologik
xususiyatlari bilan bog‘liq. Olingan natijalarga asoslanib, qizlar va o‘g‘il bolalar o‘rtasidagi
TMI farqlarini ko‘rsatish maqsadida 1-rasmda har bir yosh guruhidagi o‘zgarishlar vizual
tarzda taqdim etilgan. Ushbu rasm orqali 15, 16 va 17 yoshdagi o‘quvchilarda jinsiy tafovutlar
aniq aks ettirilgan.

tushunishga yordam beradi.
XULOSA: Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, yuqori sinf o‘quvchilari orasida tana
massasi indeksi (TMI) jinsiy farqlarga ega bo‘lib, qizlarda ortiqcha tana vazni va semirish
holatlari ko‘proq kuzatiladi. Olingan ma’lumotlarga ko‘ra, o‘smirlik davridagi gormonal
o‘zgarishlar va organizmning rivojlanish jarayonlari qizlarda ortiqcha tana vazniga moyillikni
oshirishi mumkin. Aksincha, o‘g‘il bolalarning jismoniy faollik darajasining yuqoriligi hamda
ovqatlanish odatlariga e’tibor qaratishlari ularning TMI ko‘rsatkichlarining nisbatan pastroq

bo‘lishiga sabab bo‘lishi mumkin. Ushbu natijalar semizlik va ortiqcha vaznning oldini olishga
qaratilgan profilaktik chora-tadbirlarni ishlab chiqishda muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi.
Bundan tashqari, tana massasi indeksi va umumiy salomatlik o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlikni
yanada chuqurroq tahlil qilish zarur, chunki bu o‘smirlarning hayot sifatini yaxshilash va
ularning sog‘ligini saqlashda muhim omil hisoblanadi

KIRISH
Bolalik travmasi koʻpincha jiddiy salbiy bolalik tajribasi (ACE) sifatida tavsiflanadi.
Bolalar psixologik travma sifatida tasniflanadigan bir qator tajribalarni boshdan kechirishi
mumkin; bularga beparvolik, tashlab ketilish, jinsiy zoʻravonlik, hissiy zoʻravonlik va jismoniy
zoʻravonlik, aka-uka yoki ota-onaga nisbatan zoʻravonlik guvohi boʻlish yoki ruhiy kasal otaona bilan yashash kabilar misol boʻlishi mumkin. Ushbu hodisalar chuqur psixologik, fiziologik
va sotsiologik taʼsirga ega boʻlib, sogʻliq va farovonlikka salbiy, doimiy taʼsir koʻrsatishi,
masalan, nosotsial xatti-harakatlar, diqqat yetishmasligi giperaktivligi buzilishi va uyqu
buzilishi kabilarga olib kelishi mumkin. Xuddi shunday, homiladorlik paytida travmatik yoki
stressli hodisalarni boshdan kechirgan onalari boʻlgan bolalarning ruhiy salomatlik va boshqa
neyrorivojlanish kasalliklarni boshdan kechirishi xavfi oshadi. Kaiser Permanente va
Kasalliklarni nazorat qilish va oldini olish markazlarining 1998-yildagi noxush bolalik
tajribasiga oid tadqiqoti shuni koʻrsatdiki, bolalik davridagi travmatik tajribalar koʻplab
ijtimoiy, hissiy va kognitiv buzilishlarning asosiy sababi boʻlib, bu nosogʻlom xatti-harakatlar,
zoʻravonlik yoki qayta qurbon boʻlish xavfi, surunkali salbiy sogʻliq sharoitlari, past hayot
potensiali va erta oʻlim xavfini oshiradi. Noqulay tajribalar soni ortib borayotganligi sababli,
bolalikdan kattalargacha boʻlgan muammolar xavfi ham ortadi. Dastlabki tadqiqotdan keyin 30
yillik oʻrganish buni tasdiqladi. Koʻpgina shtatlar, sogʻliqni saqlash provayderlari va boshqa
guruhlar endi ota-onalar va bolalarni ACE uchun muntazam ravishda tekshiradilar.
Voyaga yetganda bolalikdagi travma bilan boshlangan tashvish uyat, aybdorlik,
nochorlik, umidsizlik, qaygʻu va gʻazab tuygʻulari shaklida davom etishi mumkin. Bundan
tashqari, bolaligida jarohatlarga chidaganlar tashvish, ruhiy tushkunlik, oʻz joniga qasd qilish,
TSSB, giyohvandlik va spirtli ichimliklarni isteʼmol qilish va munosabatlardagi
qiyinchiliklarga koʻproq duch kelishadi. Bolalikdagi jarohatlarning oqibatlari faqat hissiy
oqibatlar bilan tugamaydi. Bolalik travmasidan omon qolganlarda, shuningdek, astma, yurakqon tomir kasalliklari, diabet yoki insult rivojlanishi xavfi yuqori. Shuningdek, ularda
oʻzlarining his-tuygʻularini tartibga solishni qiyinlashtiradigan, uyqudagi qiyinchiliklarga,
immunitetning pasayishiga va balogʻat yoshida bir qator jismoniy kasalliklarga chalinish
xavfini oshirishga olib keladigan „stressning kuchayishi “rivojlanishi ehtimoli koʻproq.
ASOSIY QISM
Bolalar psixikasi allaqachon shakllangan himoya vositalariga ega bo'lgan kattalarga
qaraganda ancha moslashuvchan va zaifdir. Shu bilan birga, bolalar o'zgarishlarga va yangi
tajribalarga osonroq va tezroq javob berishadi, shuning uchun stressning oqibatlari tezroq
davolanadi. To'g'ri qo'llab-quvvatlash bilan bola kattalarga qaraganda kamroq oqibatlarga olib
keladigan qiyin vaziyatdan o'tadi. Ammo muhim kattalar (ota-onalar yoki ularning o'rnini
bosadigan odamlar) tomonidan qo'llab-quvvatlanmasdan va yordamisiz qiyin vaziyat haqiqatan
ham jarohatlarga qadar iz qoldiradi. Bolalikda birinchi marta sodir bo'lgan psixologik travma
bolalarning psixologik shikastlanishi deb ataladi. Bolalarning psixologik jarohatlari qanday
paydo bo'ladi. Voqea shikast etkazishi uchun u bir vaqtning o'zida bir yoki bir nechta
52

mezonlarga javob berishi kerak: To'satdan sodir bo'layotgan voqealar, travmatik hodisaga
tayyorgarlik ko'rishning iloji yo'q. Bunday hodisa yaqin kishining to'satdan yo'qolishi yoki
kattalar uchun kutilmagan, haddan tashqari g'azab bo'lishi mumkin, hatto jismoniy zo'ravonlik
faktlarisiz ham. Bola o'zini himoyasiz his qiladi, nima bo'layotganini nazorat qila olmaydi va
unga qarshi tura olmaydi. U qo'llab-quvvatlamaydi yoki yordam so'rashdan qo'rqadi. Eng yorqin
misol — maktabda bezorilik, o'qituvchilar zaharlanganlarning harakatlarini "sezmaydilar" va
bola ota-onasiga aytishdan qo'rqadi, chunki ular unga ishonmaydilar yoki ularning aralashuvi
hamma narsani yomonlashtiradi. Shu bilan birga, travmatik vaziyatda nafaqat zaharlangan
odam, balki ayni paytda mavjud bo'lgan bolalar ham paydo bo'ladi — ular vaziyatni
o'zgartirishga ojiz va zo'ravonlikka duchor bo'lishdan qo'rqishadi. Bolaning idrokida, travmatik
hodisadan keyin dunyo qaytarib bo'lmaydigan darajada yomon tomonga o'zgaradi. Xuddi shu
maktabdagi bezorilik holatida, unga birinchi marta duch kelgan bola, bu boshqa har qanday
guruh yoki sinfda yana sodir bo'lishi aniq degan xulosaga keladi. Murakkab vaziyat surunkali
holatga aylanishi va shu bilan travmatik holatga aylanishi mumkin. Masalan, bola qanchalik
harakat qilmasin, ota-onasi yoki o'qituvchilari uning muvaffaqiyatlaridan qoniqmasliklari bilan
doimo duch keladi. U vaziyatga hech qanday ta'sir qilmagani uchun, uning harakatlari natija
bermaydi va muhim odamlar uni noroziligi bilan qayta-qayta "jazolaydilar", u o'zini kuchsiz his
qiladi va o'zi haqidagi fikri juda salbiy bo'lib qoladi: "men kabi bo'lish mumkin emas", "meni
sevish uchun hech narsa yo'q". Albatta, o'zingiz haqingizda bunday fikr kelajakda qurilgan
munosabatlarning sifatiga muqarrar ravishda ta'sir qiladi. Bola travmatik vaziyatga qanchalik
tez duch kelsa, jarohatni davolash shunchalik qiyin bo'ladi. Birinchidan, dastlabki voqealar
xotiradan butunlay o'chirilishi (ko'chirilishi) mumkin, jarohatdan keyin yashash qobiliyati bola
uchun yagona mumkin bo'lgan, tartibga soluvchi bo'lib ko'rinadi. Ikkinchidan, erta jarohatlar
bolaning rivojlanishining muhim bosqichlariga ta'sir qiladi va kognitiv va shaxsiy rivojlanish
sifatiga ta'sir qilishi mumkin. Ushbu o'zgarishlarni butunlay yo'q qilish mumkin emas,
davolanish travma haqidagi bilimlarga, u bilan yashash va tajribangizga tayanishga asoslangan
bo'ladi. Psixika travmani "kapsulalashga", u bilan bog'liq tajribalarni toqat qilib bo'lmaydigan
qilib almashtirishga harakat qiladi. Bu travmatik hodisani qayta baholash, unga qarshi kurashish
usullarini topishni qiyinlashtiradi. Shu bilan birga, bolaning ruhiyati gomeostazga intiladi, ya'ni
bola ongsiz ravishda o'xshash vaziyatlar va munosabatlarga jalb qilinadi, ongsiz ravishda ularni
yangi usulda "qayta yozish" umidida, vaziyatni engish mumkin bo'lgan tajribaga ega bo'ladi.
Qiyinchilik shundaki, bunday hodisani qo'llab-quvvatlamasdan qayta tiklash deyarli mumkin
emas, shuning uchun takrorlashlar retravmatik bo'lib, bolani yomon, yaxshi munosabatlar u
uchun emas, balki dunyo dushman ekanligini his qiladi.
Bolalarning psixologik shikastlanishining sabablari
Shikastlanishning eng keng tarqalgan sabablari:
Kasalliklar: surunkali, uzoq muddatli, bolani muloqotda, harakatda, tanlash erkinligida
cheklaydi. Og'riqli protseduralar, og'riq, tashvish, o'zingizni "boshqalardan farq qiladigan"his
qilish. Psixologik bosim: bolani taqqoslash orqali tarbiyalash, xato bo'lsa rad etish, sevgi va
53

e'tibor faqat "to'g'ri" xatti-harakatlar sharti bilan beriladi. Jismoniy va jinsiy zo'ravonlik.
Etkazilgan aniq zarardan tashqari, zo'ravonlik holatlari xiyonat tajribasi bilan kuchayadi, chunki
ular ko'pincha uni himoya qilish uchun chaqirilgan bolaning yaqin atrofidagi odamlardan kelib
chiqadi. Yaqiningizni yo'qotish, ayniqsa uni kimdir bilan birga yoqish imkoniyati bo'lmasa.
Bola uchun muhim masalalarda kattalar tomonidan adolatsiz munosabat, xiyonat; masxara
qilish, qadr-qimmatni kamsitish.
Ota-onalarning har qanday" mo'rtligi": kimyoviy (alkogol, giyohvandlik) va kimyoviy
bo'lmagan (qimor) qaramliklar, hissiy labillik, reaktsiyalarning oldindan aytib bo'lmaydiganligi,
yaqin qarindoshining psixiatrik kasalliklari (kompensatsiyalanmagan yoki aniqlanmagan).
Shunga qaramay, yuqorida sanab o'tilgan sabablar ham bolaning ruhiyatiga bunday
halokatli ta'sir ko'rsatmasligi mumkin, agar uning yonida nima bo'layotganini qo'llabquvvatlaydigan va tushunarli tilda tushuntira oladigan kattalar bo'lsa.
Travmatizmning sanab o'tilgan sabablariga muvofiq, bolalarning psixologik
shikastlanishining quyidagi turlarini nomlash mumkin:
-rad etish travmasi;
-ajralish travmasi;
-yo'qotish travmasi;
-hayot va sog'liq uchun jismoniy tahdidning shikastlanishi;
-psixologik zo'ravonlik travmasi.
Turlarga bo'linish, albatta, juda shartli. Biz etakchi travmatik jarayon haqida gapirishimiz
mumkin, ammo u bolalarning psixologik shikastlanishlarining bir nechta turlari bilan birga
bo'lishi mumkin. Masalan, bezorilik natijasida bola psixologik zo'ravonlik, jismoniy tahdid
travmasi (agar jismoniy zo'ravonlik bo'lsa), rad etish travmasi bilan shug'ullanadi. Uning
tajribalarini baham ko'radigan hech kim yo'q, kattalarga aytishga urinishlar rad etish va g'azabga
duch kelishi mumkin va bu joyda bola sharmandalikni boshdan kechiradi: "bu faqat men bilan
sodir bo'lishi mumkin edi, chunki men boshqalarga o'xshamayman, men hammadan
yomonman". Travmatik hodisadan ko'p o'tmay, sotsializatsiya buzilishi, o'rganishdagi
qiyinchiliklar, xatti-harakatlar, tashvish va ba'zida tajovuzkorlikning kuchayishi kuzatiladi.
Bunga odatdagi turmush tarzini olib borishga xalaqit beradigan qo'rquvlar ham kiradi (uxlab
qolish, tashqariga chiqish, xonada yolg'iz qolish). Nevrotik namoyishlar mumkin: enurez,
obsesif harakatlar, duduqlanish, titroq. Dastlabki oqibatlar travmatik hodisadan ko'p o'tmay
sodir bo'ladi. Kechiktirilganlarga travmatik tajriba asosida shakllangan kattalarda namoyon
bo'ladigan oqibatlar kiradi. Yoshi bilan, bunday bola shikastlanishga duch kelgan psixologik
"men" ning bir qismini kapsulalaydi va izolyatsiya qiladi. Shuning uchun, travmatik hodisalarga
o'xshash yoki shunga o'xshash tajribalarni keltirib chiqaradigan holatlarda, kattalar bu qismga
"sho'ng'iydi", omon qolish uchun og'ir vaziyatni mustaqil ravishda engishga majbur bo'lgan
bolaga aylanadi. Bolalikning travmatik holati va haqiqatda sodir bo'layotgan voqealar
o'rtasidagi farqlar yo'q bo'lib ketganday tuyuladi. Masalan, bolaligida jismoniy zo'ravonlik
holatini boshdan kechirgan odam, eng kichik tahdid bilan (haqiqiy yoki taxmin qilingan),
54

kattalar imkoniyatlari, kattalar pozitsiyasidan nima qilishi mumkinligi, kimga yordam so'rashi
mumkinligi haqidagi tasavvurini yo'qotadi. U yana himoyasiz va qo'rqinchli bo'lib chiqadi,
qotib qolishga va qarshilik ko'rsatmaslikka yoki qo'rquvni bostirishga va tajovuzni iloji boricha
aniq ko'rsatishga majbur bo'ladi, haqiqiy vaziyatni hisobga olmaganda. Tahdid sifatida nafaqat
to'g'ridan-to'g'ri tajovuz, balki beparvolik bilan aytilgan so'z, yoqimsiz qarash, muhim odamlar
(sherik, xo'jayin) tomonidan norozilik reaktsiyasi ham ko'rib chiqilishi mumkin. Travmatik
tajriba uzoq muddatli yaqin munosabatlarni saqlashga, noo'rin munosabatlardan chiqishga
xalaqit beradi, hayotidagi voqealar ustidan nazorat tuyg'usini yo'qotishga, "muzlatish" ga
yordam beradi (his-tuyg'ularning namoyon bo'lishidan voz kechish va eng yomon holatda o'z
his-tuyg'ularini his qilishdan bosh tortish). Vujudingizni rad etish, hayotiy ehtiyojlarni (ochlik,
chanqoqlik) tan olishda qiyinchiliklar paydo bo'lishi mumkin. Rad etish travmasi va psixologik
zo'ravonlikning yana bir og'ir oqibati — bu yolg'on o'zini shakllantirish, bu erda haqiqiy o'zini
anglash tushunchasi shakllanmagan, ammo siz qanday bo'lishingiz kerakligi haqida rasm
mavjud. Haqiqiy va xayoliy o'rtasidagi har qanday aniqlangan farq juda ko'p sharmandalik,
aybdorlik va qo'rquvni keltirib chiqaradi. Ideal "men" ning xayoliy surati odatda qat'iydir, hayot
sharoitlari o'zgarganda o'zgarmaydi va hech qachon to'liq erishib bo'lmaydi.
Bolaning shikastlanganligini qanday tushunish mumkin?
Ilgari bo'lmagan xatti-harakatlardagi o'zgarishlarning paydo bo'lishi, qo'rquv, allaqachon
shakllangan ko'nikmalarning yo'qolishi (o'qish yomonlashdi, tez-tez kasal bo'lib, muloqotdan
qochadi va hokazo) bolalarning psixologik shikastlanishining belgisi bo'lishi mumkin.
Duduqlanish, nutqda ikkilanish, obsesif harakatlarning kutilmagan ko'rinishi ham ota-onalarni
ogohlantirishi kerak. Ehtimol, bola tez-tez xafa bo'lib, doimo g'amgin bo'lib, tez-tez yig'lay
boshlagan. Yoki, aksincha, giperaktivlik paydo bo'ldi, diqqatni jamlash qiyinlashdi, xattiharakatlar tajovuzkor bo'lib qoldi, janjal va nizolar tez-tez uchrab turdi.
Diagnostika suhbatni, bolaning xatti-harakatlarini va uning yangi joyga moslashish
usullarini kuzatishni (psixologning kabinetida), bolalarning psixologik shikastlanishlari uchun
rasm va o'yin testlarini o'z ichiga oladi. Ba'zida bola qulay bo'lishi va o'yinda o'z tajribalarini
gapira olishi yoki ko'rsatishi uchun bir nechta uchrashuvlar talab qilinishi mumkin. Bolalikda
psixologik jarohatlarning dastlabki oqibatlarini tuzatish Art-terapevtik, o'yin texnikasi
yordamida amalga oshiriladi. Qum terapiyasi va egiluvchan materiallar bilan o'zaro ta'siri o'zini
yaxshi isbotladi: kinetik qum, loy, plastilin, xamir. Travmatik vaziyatda va undan keyin otaonalarning yordami oqibatlarni bekor qilishi yoki ularni minimallashtirishi mumkin. Buning
uchun bolaga uning namoyon bo'lishini to'xtatmasdan yoki maslahat yoki ayblovlarga murojaat
qilmasdan gapirishga, yig'lashga yoki poz berishga ruxsat berish kerak. Bolaning o'zi to'xtashni
tanlamaguncha jarayonni to'xtatmaslik muhimdir. Atrofda bo'lish, quchoqlash, aytilganlarning
eshitilganligini tasdiqlash kifoya. Bolani qo'llab-quvvatlashning eng muhim shartlaridan biri bu
ota-onaning xotirjamligi va barqarorligini saqlashdir. Agar kattalar o'z his-tuyg'ularini engishga
qodir bo'lmasa, bola ota-onasini to'xtatishga yoki hatto tinchlantirishni boshlashga majbur
bo'ladi va bu uning qo'llab-quvvatlashning iloji yo'qligi haqidagi g'oyasini tasdiqlaydi.

Bolalarning psixologik shikastlanishining kechiktirilgan ta'siriga duch kelgan kattalar uchun
psixologga murojaat qilish imkoniyati mavjud. Mutaxassisning yordami bilan siz o'zingizga,
bolalaringizning cheklovlariga va kattalar imkoniyatlariga yangi nuqtai nazarni yaratib,
shikastlanishning sabablarini o'rganishingiz va uni takrorlashingiz mumkin. Travma-bu yolg'iz
kirish qiyin, deyarli imkonsiz bo'lgan qorong'i joy. Uning kuchi va ta'siri ishonchli aloqa,
yordam va boshqa odamning mavjudligi tufayli "parchalanadi".
Bolalikda olingan psixotravmalarni psixokorreksiyalashning bir necha usullari mavjud.
Bularning ichida art terapiya usuli juda samarali hisoblanadi. Art-terapiya bolalar
psixoterapiyasida psixologik yordamning eng mashhur va talab qilinadigan usullaridan biridir.
Bolalar, ayniqsa maktabgacha yoshdagi bolalar va boshlang'ich maktab o'quvchilari ijodda
qiziqish bilan qatnashadilar va jarayonning o'zi va natijalarini Art-terapevt bilan muhokama
qiladilar.
Art terapiya usullari
Yo'nalish variantlari har qanday lazzat uchun tanlanishi mumkin:
-rasm chizish,
-modellashtirish,
-harakat o'z-o'zidan raqs sifatida,
-qo'shiq aytish,
-bepul xayol,
-dramatik spektakl,
-qum terapiyasi,
-qo'g'irchoq terapiyasi,
-san'at ob'ektlarini ko'rib chiqish.
Ularning aytishicha, san'atning qancha turlari mavjud-Art terapiyasining ko'p turlarini
yaratish mumkin.
Art-terapiya nima uchun foydali?
Usul bolaning psixo-emotsional holatini yaxshilashga, stressni (hissiy va jismoniy)
engillashtirishga, qo'rquvni qayta ishlashga va yo'q qilishga, murakkab voqealarni (ko'chish,
bolalar bog'chasi yoki maktabni o'zgartirish, yo'qotishlar va boshqalar) engishga yordam beradi.
Shu bilan birga, bolaning rivojlanishi rag'batlantiriladi, chunki ish jarayonida o'z-o'zini aks
ettirish rivojlanadi (ularning his-tuyg'ularini tushunish va ularni nomlash qobiliyati) va tashvish
va zo'riqishni kamaytirish orqali kognitiv faoliyat uchun resurslar chiqariladi. Usulning yana bir
afzalligi — bu ish paytida bolaning holatini to'g'ridan-to'g'ri tashxislash imkoniyati.
Bolalar uchun Art terapiya natijaga e'tibor qaratmaydi. Ijodkorlik jarayonining o'zi va
bolaning bu jarayonda nimani his qilishi va boshdan kechirishi muhimroqdir. Natija
baholanmaydi va bu yomon va noto'g'ri qilish qo'rquvini yo'qotishga yordam beradi. Yangi
narsalarni yaratib, bola biron bir narsani o'ylab topishga, o'z g'oyasini amalga oshirishga va uni
zavq bilan bajarishga qodirligini bilib oladi. Ishning majburiy elementi-bu bola bilan ijodkorlik
paytida va undan keyin darhol uning his-tuyg'ularini muhokama qilish.
56

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Usul yoshga bog'liq jiddiy cheklovlarga ega emas-siz bolalar bilan taxminan ikki yoshdan
boshlab Art-terapiya texnikasida ishlashingiz mumkin. Bolaning ijodiy ifodaga qiziqishi va
hech bo'lmaganda cheklangan holda nima bo'layotgani haqida gapirish imkoniyatiga ega
bo'lishi kifoya. Maktabgacha yoshdagi bolalar uchun Art-terapiya usullari individual darslarga
ham, guruhlarga ham kiradi. Albatta, eng yosh bolalar uchun individual mashg'ulotlar
afzalroqdir, garchi katta guruhda (3-4 kishi) ishlaganda ham usul yaxshi natijalarni ko'rsatadi.
Katta yoshdagi bolalar uchun guruh mashg'ulotlari ijodiy ifodalashga va nevrotik simptomlarni
engillashtirishga yordam beradi. Shuningdek, ular tengdoshlar o'zlarining qiyinchiliklari
qanday yashayotganini ko'rish, o'z tajribalarida yolg'iz emasliklarini his qilish imkoniyatini
beradi.
Bolalarda qo'rquv uchun Art terapiya
Ayniqsa, ko'pincha Art-terapiya maktabgacha yoshdagi bolalar va yosh o'quvchilar bilan
ishlashda qo'llaniladi. 5-8 yoshda bolalarda odatda ko'plab qo'rquvlar paydo bo'ladi. Bunday
o'sish tasavvurning rivojlanishi va bolaning ijtimoiy faolligining oshishi bilan bog'liq. Ijtimoiy
aloqalar kengayib bormoqda, bolaning hayotida bolalar bog'chasi va/yoki boshlang'ich maktab
paydo bo'ladi. Bola yangi ma'lumotlarga kirish huquqiga ega, u yangi odamlar bilan o'zaro
aloqada bo'ladi va ko'plab his-tuyg'ularni "hazm qilishga" majbur bo'ladi, ba'zida umuman
ijtimoiy jihatdan maqbul emas. Bolada juda ko'p zo'riqish bor, ayniqsa u bolalar jamoasida juda
muvaffaqiyatli bo'lmasa yoki uning yangi kattalar (o'qituvchilar, o'qituvchilar) bilan
munosabatlari yaxshilanmasa. Stress va xavotirning kuchayishi bolalarning faol fantaziyasi
hayvonlar, terrorchilar, xavfli hayvonlar va boshqalarning qo'rqinchli tasvirlariga aylanadi.
Bolalardagi qo'rquv uchun Art-terapiya qo'rquv tasvirlarini to'g'ridan-to'g'ri belgilashga va uni
engish yo'lini topishga va umumiy tashvishlarni bartaraf etishga qaratilgan bir qator mashqlarni
o'z ichiga oladi.
Xulosa
Qo'rquv bilan qanday ishlash kerak? Uyda qo'rquv bilan kurashish strategiyasini izlash
shunday ko'rinishi mumkin. Voyaga etgan kishi bolani qo'rquv mavzusida bir qator chizmalar
chizishga taklif qiladi. Birinchi rasmda dahshatli vaziyatning o'zi — qahramonning qo'rquv
ob'ekti bilan uchrashuvi tasvirlangan bo'lishi mumkin. Bu erda qahramon bolaning o'zi emas,
balki uning ba'zi vakili (ba'zi o'g'il yoki qiz yoki bola tanlagan har qanday belgi). Qahramon
ramziy rol o'ynaydi, siz u bilan bog'lanishingiz mumkin va shu bilan birga uning
sarguzashtlarini tashqaridan kuzatib, juda qo'rqmaysiz. Keyingi rasmlarda siz qo'rquv ob'ekti
hayotidan hikoyalar chizishingiz mumkin-u qaerda yashaydi, kim bilan muloqot qiladi, nima
qiladi va nimani xohlaydi. Shunday qilib, qo'rquv o'rganiladi va rasmning ramziy roli bolaga
qo'rquv ob'ektining inkor etiladigan individual xususiyatlarini o'zlashtirishga imkon beradi. Bu
kuch, qat'iyatlilik, o'jarlik, g'azablanish qobiliyati bo'lishi mumkin — qo'rqinchli tasavvurdagi
yirtqich hayvon, ehtimol, quyidagilardan biriga ega. Bola kattalar yonida rasm chizish bilan
shug'ullanadi, u savollar berishi, sodir bo'layotgan voqealarni aks ettirishi, qo'rquv ob'ektining
o'ziga ham foydali bo'lishi mumkin bo'lgan fazilatlarini sezishi va nomlashi mumkin. Bir qator
57

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

chizmalar tugagandan so'ng, siz qahramonning qo'rqinchli ob'ekt bilan uchrashuvi holatini
qayta chizishingiz mumkin. Shu bilan birga, qo'rquv haqida rasm chizish paytida ma'lum
bo'lgan hamma narsani eslang va qahramon obrazini xavfga qarshi turishga yordam beradigan
yangi fazilatlar bilan to'ldiring. Chizmalarning butun seriyasini bir vaqtning o'zida chizish
mumkin yoki agar bola charchagan bo'lsa, bir nechta seanslarga bo'linishi mumkin. Agar
kattalar ishni davom ettirishni talab qilmasa va bolani chalg'itishga imkon bersa yaxshi bo'ladi.
Rasmlarga qiziqish ko'rsatib, davom ettirish va qo'llab-quvvatlash uchun muloyimlik bilan
taklif qilish kifoya. Qo'rquv bilan ishlash bola uchun qiyin bo'lishi mumkin. U qo'rquvga botish
jarayonini o'zi tartibga solishi va agar bu juda qiyin bo'lsa, to'xtashi mumkin.

KIRISH. Ma’lumki, bugungi kunda yuz berayotgan voqealar miqyosining o‘zgarishi
sharoitida o‘quv dasturlarini ishlab chiquvchilar, siyosatchilardan boshlab, to sinfda bolalar
bilan bevosita ishlayotgan barcha pedagoglarga qadar bolalarni kelajakdagi hayotlari samarali,
ta’minlangan va omadli bo‘lishiga yaxshi tayyorlash masalasi har qachongidan ham dolzarb
ekanligiga amin bo‘lmoqdalar.
Mustaqil ishlarini tashkil etish va uni ilmiy-metodik jihatdan samarali boshqarish
nafaqat ta’lim-tarbiya jarayonida, balki insoning hayotdagi barcha harakatlarida mustaqil
fikrlashga o‘rgatadi. Bu o‘z navbatida inson jamiyatda o‘z o‘rnini tezroq topishga xizmat
qiladi. Psixologiya fanini o‘qitishning nazariy asoslarini chuqur egallamay turib o‘qitishni
ilmiy asosda tashkil qilish, ta’lim-tarbiya ishlarini uzviy birligiga erishish, mustaqil fikrlashni
shakllantirish, o‘qitish usullarini doimo takomillashtirib borish vazifasini muvaffaqiyatli hal
qilib bo‘lmaydi.[1.25]
ADABIYOTLAR TAHLILI VA METODOLOGIYA. Mazkur muammoni uzluksiz
davom etayotgan axborotlar girdobi yanada mukammallashtirmoqda. Bugun o‘quvchilarga
imkoniyatlarimizga qarab bera oladigan axborotlar ular butun tarkibining juda oz qismini va
ularning butun hayoti davomida kerak bo‘ladigan axborotning faqat kichik qismini tashkil
etadi. Ushbu asrda demokratik va iqtisodiy jihatdan sermaxsul hayotga o‘quvchilarni qanday
qilib yaxshiroq tayyorlashimiz mumkinligi haqidagi eng muhim savol bugungi kun
o‘qituvchilarining diqqat markazida bo‘lishi zarur. Boshqacha aytganda o‘qituvchilarning
vazifasi qanday qilib o‘quvchilarning samarali o‘qish va mustaqil fikrlashga o‘rganishni
o‘zlashtirib olishiga erishish bo‘lmog‘i lozim. Ya’ni talabalar yangi axborotga duch
kelganda, mustaqil tafakkur orqali mushohada yurita olish ko‘nikmasini egallashi kerak.
Ilmning barcha sohalarida axborotlar seldek oqib kelayotan hozirgi davrda ular mazkur
axborotlardan o‘zlari uchun foydali bo‘lgan jihatlarini ko‘rib chiqib, o‘z tasavvurlariga
muvofiq axborot va fikrlarni mustaqil ravishda baholashni o‘rganishlari lozim. Ular yangi
fikrlarni har tomonlama ko‘rib chiqa olishlari, mazkur axborotlarning qimmati va aniqligiga
doir xulosalar chiqarishlari, o‘z maqsad va talablari asosida fikrlarning umumiy qimmatini
belgilay bilishlari lozim. [2.90]
Hozirgi vaqtda axborotlarning jadallik bilan kengayib borishi, “Jahon ta’lim tizimi
doirasida madaniyatlarni o‘zaro ayriboshlash jarayonida axborotlashgan jamiyatga o‘tilishi”
o‘quvchilarda mustaqil fikrlashni shakllantirish orqaligina turli axborot hurujlaridan samarali
himoyalana olish imkonini berishini ham aytib o‘tish zarur. O‘zbekiston Respublikasining

kuchlarning manfaatlarigagina xizmat qiladigan, olis-yaqin manbalardan tarqaladigan, turli
ma’no-mazmundagi mafkuraviy kuchlarning ta’sirini doimiy ravishda sezib yashaydi.
[3.112]
Mana shunday bir vaziyatda odam o‘z mustaqil fikriga, sobit e’tiqodiga, o‘zi tayanib
yashaydigan xayotiy-milliy qadriyatlariga, shakllangan dunyoqarash va mustahkam irodaga
ega bo‘lmasa, har turli mafkuralarning bosimiga, ularning goh oshkora, goh pinhona
ko‘rinishdagi tazyiqlariga bardosh berishi amrimaxol”.
Tafakkurni mustaqillik talablariga hamda hozirgi axborotlar texnologiyasi hayotning
barcha sohalariga shiddat bilan kirib kelayotgan, butun dunyoda globallashuv tendensiyalari
kuchayib borayotgan davr talablariga moslashtirmasdan turib, jamiyatdagi ijtimoiy iqtisodiy
hamda ma’naviy-ma’rifiy islohotlarni yuqori sur’atlarda va muvaffaqiyatli davom ettirish
mushkul. Bundan tashqari, yildan-yilga kuchayotgan raqobat, ba’zi davlatlarning jug‘rofiysiyosiy huruji va mafkuraviy tazyiqlari, axborotlar huruji, diniy-ekstremistik tashviqotlarning
susaymayotganligi dolzarb masalaga aylantirmoqda. Aholining muayyan qismi, ayniqsa,
tajribasiz yoshlar turli sohta shiorlar, chaqiriqlar, xalqimizga yot, buzg‘inchi g‘oyalar ta’siriga
tushib qolishning oldini olish uchun avvalo, ularni mustaqil, tanqidiy, erikn fikrlarga o‘rgatish,
ular tafakkurini ijobiy mazmundagi bunyodkorlikka yo‘naltirish lozim. Faqat erkin va
mustaqil, tanqidiy va ijodiy fikrlay oladigan kishilardagina mutaassiblikka, turli buzg‘unchi
g‘oyalarga nisbatan mafkuraviy immunitet oson vujudga keladi. [4.78]
MUHOKAMA VA NATIJALAR. Aynan talabalarning mustaqil fikrlashini
shakllantirish orqali demokratik va insonparvar jamiyat uchun asosiy qadriyat sanalgan
“jamiyat hayotida faol ishtirok etish”, “hamkorlik”, “individuallashtirish”, “ongli intizom”,
“tolerantlik”, “qadr-qimmat”, “erkinlik” kabi tushunchalar hayotda o‘z amaliy tasdig‘ini
topadi. Shu bilan birga, mazkur qadriyatlarni amalga oshirish orqali talabalarda mustaqil
fikrlash ko‘nikmalari shakllanadi.
Demokratik jamiyatni barpo etish uchun uning har bir a’zosi jamiyat hayotida faol
ishtirok etishi lozim. Bu fuqarolarning jamiyatdagi muammolarni bilishi va o‘z ishonchlarini
saqlab qola olishlarini bildiradi. Mustaqil fikrlay oladigan shaxslargina, demokratik jamiyat
hayotida faol ishtirok eta oladilar. [5.148]
Demokratik jamiyatda hamkorlikdagi a’zolar orasidagi tenglik qo‘llab-quvvatlanishi
zarur. Shaxs boshqalar bilan hamkorlik qilishi uchun uning o‘zi mustaqil tashabbusni namoyon
eta olishi, o‘z fikriga boshqalarda ishonch hosil qildira olishi lozim. Demak, erkin fikrlay olish
samarali hamkorlikning asosidir.
Demokratlashtirishda individuallik jamiyat oldidagi mas’uliyatlilik bilan
uyg‘unlashadi. Erkin faoliyat ko‘rsatishga ega bo‘lish shaxs uchun tarixiy, ijtimoiy va axloqiy
qadriyat bo‘lib, uning individualligining namoyon bo‘lishi va jamiyat taraqqiyoti darajasining
mezonidir. Shaxs erkinligini poymol etish, uning ongi va xulq-atvorini bir qolipga solishga
62

intilish, individlarni jamiyat, davlatni boshqarish ishlaridan amalda chetlatish shaxs
kamolotiga salbiy tasir ko‘rsatish bilan birga taraqqiyotni ham sekinlatadi, turg‘un xolatga
keltiradi va hatto tanazzulga olib keladi. Shu bilan birga individuallik shaxs o‘zining xattixarakatlari uchun javob bera olishini ta’lab etadi. Individuallik - mustaqil fikrlashning muhim
sharti. Erkin jamiyatda fikr va qarashlardagi xilma-xillikni tushunish hamda shunga intilishni
rivojlantirish zarur. [6.60]
Demokratik jamiyatda erkin fikrlay oladigan shaxslar qadr-qimmatga ega bo‘ladilar.
O‘z navbatida ular boshqalarning intilish va fikrlarini qadrlay oladilar. Qadr-qimmat
shaxsning ijtimoiy va ma’naviy erkinligining muhim tomoni sifatida yuzaga chiqadi. Erkinlikmustaqil fikrlash uchun qo‘yilgan birinchi qadamdir. [7.138]
Mustaqil fikrning mavjudligi va rivojlanishi ko‘p jihatdan o‘quvchilarning erkinlik
darajasiga bog‘liq. Mustaqil fikrlashni shakllantirish va rivojlantirish uchun o‘quvchilarning
individual va jomoaviy darajada erkinligiga erishish zarur. Chunki “mustaqil fikrlash
shaxsning hislati sifatida har qanday faoliyat turida individual va jamoaviy yutuqlarga
erishishda yuqori kursatkichni ta’minlaydigan muhim omillardan biri bo‘lib qoladi”. Shu
bilan birga, “mustaqil fikrlash jamiyat insonga yaratib bergan imkoniyat va erkinliklarning
mahsuli va inikosidir”. Fikrlash esa, shaxs bilish faoliyati jarayoni bo‘lib, voqelikni bevosita
va umumlashgan xolda aks ettirish bilan xarakterlanadi. Fikrlash fanlararo tadqiqotlarni,
kompleks fanlarni o‘zida mujassamlashtiradi. Falsafa materiya bilan bog‘liqlikda fikrlash
yordamida dunyoni bilishning yo‘llari va imkoniyatlarini o‘rganadi. [8.230]
Fikrlash - aqliy faoliyat mahsuli. Eng asosiysi, fikrlash-merosiy tushuncha, u barcha
insonlarga xos. Falsafiy, pedagogik, psixologik adabiyotlarda fikrlashning bir qancha turlari
ajratib ko‘rsatiladi. [9.10] Har biri o‘zining tadqiqot ob’ektidan kelib chiqqan xolda qaysi
birlarini asosiy deb qarashga moyildirlar. Jumladan, falsafiy, psixologik, pedagogik
lug‘atlarda fikrlashning quyidagi turlari ajratib ko‘rsatiladi: mantiqiy, abstrakt (mavhum),
umumlashgan, nazariy, texnik, reproduktiv, ijodiy (produktiv), tizimli, kategorial, induktiv,
deduktiv, algoritmik, tanqidiy va boshqalar. Biroq xech birida “Mustaqil fikrlash nima?”
degan savolga javob mavjud emas va xatto fikrlash turlari qatoriga kiritilmaydi. Chet el davriy
nashrlari, pedagogik va psixologik adabiyotlarida ham mazkur tushunchaning mukammal
ta’rifi ko‘zga tashlanmaydi. [10.12]
XULOSA. Zamonaviy metodlar yoki interfaol usullar, o‘qitishning samarasini oshirishga
yordam beruvchi texnologik treninglar talabalarda mantiqiy ijodiy, tanqidiy mustaqil fikrlashni
shakllantirishga yordam beradi. Bulardan tashqari hozirgi integratsiyalashgan sharoitda
o‘quvchi yoshlarning atrof muhitga nisbatan mustaqil fikrlarini shakllantirishda ekologik ta’lim
tarbiyaning ham ahamiyati kattadir. Chunki ekologik ta’lim-tarbiya umumiy ta’limning o‘zaro
aloqadorligi, insonni uning o‘rab turgan tabiatga nisbatan ma’suliyati to‘g‘risidagi umumiy
tasavvur va mustaqil fikrlash asoslarini shakllantirishga asoslangandir.
Bugungi kunda insonlarning mustaqil fikrlashga o‘rgatish, yurt kelajagini qurush
demakdir. O‘sib kelayotgan yosh avlodning fikrlash rivojlantirib borish va ularning to‘g‘ri
63

yo‘naltirish yoshlarning fikrlash doirasini kengaytirishdan boshlanishini ta’kidlamog‘imiz
kerak.

Annotation. This article analyzes the relationship between adolescents' social identity
crisis and their tendency toward criminal behavior. The study scientifically substantiates the
predisposition of young people to deviant behavior based on Erik Erikson’s "Identity and
Crisis" theory, James Marcia’s "Identity Status Theory", and Travis Hirschi’s "Social
Control Theory." The article presents effective measures for preventing juvenile delinquency,
including enhancing the role of social institutions, improving psychological support systems,
and the necessity of individualized work with adolescents.
Keywords: adolescents, social identification, identity crisis, crime, social control,
deviant behavior.
Kirish. O‘smirlik davri inson hayotidagi eng muhim bosqichlardan biri bo‘lib, bu davrda
shaxsning ijtimoiy identifikatsiyasi shakllanadi. O‘smirlar kim ekanliklari, qaysi guruhlarga
tegishli ekanliklari va jamiyatda o‘z o‘rinlarini qanday topishlari haqida fikrlay boshlaydilar.
Ushbu jarayonda yuzaga keladigan inqiroz holatlari ularning xulq-atvoriga jiddiy ta’sir
ko‘rsatishi mumkin. Agar o‘smir o‘zini jamiyatda aniqlay olmasa yoki o‘z qadr-qimmatini his
qilmasa, u deviant xatti-harakatlarga, jumladan, jinoyatchilikka moyillik ko‘rsatishi mumkin.
Ushbu maqolada ijtimoiy identifikatsiya inqirozi va uning jinoyatchilikka olib kelishi sabablari
tahlil qilinadi. [1].
Adabiyotlar tahlili. o‘smirlarning ijtimoiy identifikatsiyasi va jinoyatchilikka moyilligi
sоhasidagi tadqiqоtlar xоrij psixоlоglari tоmоnidan ham atrоflicha о‘rganilgan. Jumladan: Erik
Erikson, Travis Hirshi, James Marcia va bоshqa psixоlоglar tоmоnidan оlib bоrilgan ilmiy
tadqiqоt ishlarida ham о‘z aksini tоpgan.
Erik Erikson (1902–1994) o‘zining psixosotsial rivojlanish nazariyasi orqali shaxsiy
identifikatsiya va o‘sish jarayonlarini tahlil qilgan. U insonning hayoti davomida o‘tadigan
sakkizta bosqichni belgilagan bo‘lib, ulardan biri o‘smirlik davrida (12–18 yosh)
identifikatsiya va rol chalkashligi inqirozi bilan bog‘liq. Ushbu nazariya aynan o‘smirlarning
shaxsiyati shakllanishi, jamiyatdagi o‘rnini aniqlash va identifikatsiya inqirozi natijasida
deviant yoki jinoyatchilikka moyillik rivojlanishining mexanizmlarini tushuntirishda muhim
ahamiyatga ega. Eriksonning ta’kidlashicha, ijtimoiy identifikatsiya shakllanmagan hollarda
o‘smir:
✅O‘zini tengdoshlari orasida begona his qiladi.
✅ Jamiyat tomonidan qabul qilinmaganini sezadi.
✅ Norasmiy guruhlarga qo‘shilishi yoki deviant xatti-harakatlarga moyil bo‘lishi
mumkin.
Travis Hirshi (1969) tomonidan ilgari surilgan Ijtimoiy nazorat nazariyasi (Social
Control Theory) ijtimoiy bog‘liqlik darajasi va shaxsning jinoyatchilikka moyilligi o‘rtasidagi
bog‘liqlikni tahlil qiladi. Unga ko‘ra, insonlar tug‘ma jinoyatchilar emas, balki jamiyat va
ijtimoiy tizim tomonidan tartibga solinadigan mavjudotlardir. Agar shaxs jamiyat bilan
66

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

mustahkam bog‘langan bo‘lsa, u jinoyatchilikdan uzoq bo‘ladi. Biroq, agar bu bog‘liqlik
zaiflashsa, u jinoyatga moyil bo‘lishi mumkin.
Hirshining nazariyasi shuni ko‘rsatadiki, agar o‘smir jamiyat bilan bog‘liq bo‘lsa, u
jinoyatchilikka kamroq moyil bo‘ladi. Aksincha, agar o‘smir:

Ota-onasi bilan yaxshi munosabatda bo‘lmasa,

Ta’lim yoki ijtimoiy hayotdan uzoq bo‘lsa,

Muvaffaqiyatga erishish motivatsiyasiga ega bo‘lmasa,

Qonun va axloqiy qadriyatlarga e’tibor bermasa, u jinoyat sodir etishga
moyil bo‘lishi mumkin.
James Marcia (1966) Erik Eriksonning "identifikatsiya va inqiroz" g‘oyasini
kengaytirib, identifikatsiya holatlari nazariyasi (Identity Status Theory) ni ishlab chiqdi.
Ushbu nazariya yoshlarning identifikatsiya jarayonidan qanday o‘tishini tushuntiradi va
ularning shaxsiy identifikatsiyasini shakllantirish jarayonini to‘rtta asosiy holatga ajratadi. 1.
Identifikatsiya diffuziyasi (Identity Diffusion) 2. Majburan qabul qilingan identifikatsiya
(Foreclosure) 3. Identifikatsiya inqirozi (Moratorium) 4. Muvaffaqiyatli identifikatsiya
(Identity Achievement). [2].
Muhokama va natijalar. Yoshlarning ijtimoiy identifikatsiya inqirozi va jinoyatchilikka
moyilligi o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik turli nazariyalar va empirik tadqiqotlar asosida o‘rganildi. Erik
Eriksonning psixososial rivojlanish nazariyasi, James Marcia tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan
identifikatsiya holatlari nazariyasi, shuningdek, Travis Hirshining ijtimoiy nazorat nazariyasi
o‘smirlarning ijtimoiy identifikatsiya jarayonida duch keladigan muammolar va ularning
deviant xatti-harakatlarga moyilligini tushuntirishga yordam beradi.
Tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, ijtimoiy bog‘lanishning yetishmovchiligi, ijtimoiy
institutlarga ishonchsizlik va identifikatsiya inqirozi yoshlarning jinoyatchilikka moyilligini
oshiradi. Marcia nazariyasiga ko‘ra, identifikatsiya diffuziyasi va moratorium bosqichlarida
bo‘lgan yoshlar, agar ular tegishli ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlovga ega bo‘lmasa, xavfli xattiharakatlarga yo‘liqishi mumkin. Bundan tashqari, Hirshining nazariyasiga muvofiq, oila,
maktab va jamiyat bilan bo‘lgan bog‘lanish darajasi jinoyatchilikka qarshi asosiy himoya omili
sifatida xizmat qiladi.
Natijalar
1.
Identifikatsiya jarayoni va jinoyatchilik o‘rtasida kuchli bog‘liqlik mavjud –
Yoshlar o‘z shaxsiyatini shakllantirish jarayonida qiyinchiliklarga duch kelganida, ular o‘zini
jamiyatdan ajratilgan his qiladi va noqonuniy faoliyatga moyil bo‘lishi mumkin.
2.
Ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlovning yetishmovchiligi muhim omil – Ota-onalar,
o‘qituvchilar va jamiyat tomonidan yetarli e’tibor qaratilmasa, yoshlar o‘z identifikatsiyasini
mustahkamlashda qiyinchiliklarga duch keladi, bu esa deviant xatti-harakatlarga olib kelishi
mumkin.

3.
Bandlik va ijtimoiy faoliyat yoshlarni jinoyatchilikdan saqlaydi – O‘smirlarning
sport, san’at, volontyorlik va kasbiy ta’limga jalb qilinishi ularning ijtimoiy integratsiyasini
kuchaytirib, huquqbuzarlikning oldini oladi.
4.
Erta profilaktika va psixologik yordam muhim – Ijtimoiy identifikatsiya inqirozi
bilan bog‘liq muammolarni bartaraf etish uchun yoshlar bilan individual ishlash, psixologik
maslahatlar berish va reabilitatsiya dasturlarini joriy etish zarur.
O‘smirlarning ijtimoiy identifikatsiya inqirozini kamaytirish va jinoyatchilikka
moyilligini oldini olish uchun kompleks yondashuv zarur. Bunda oilaviy qo‘llab-quvvatlash,
ta’lim tizimidagi islohotlar, ijtimoiy tadbirlar va huquqiy choralar muhim rol o‘ynaydi.
Identifikatsiya jarayonini ijobiy yo‘nalishga yo‘naltirish orqali yoshlarning jamiyatga
integratsiyasini oshirish va jinoyatchilik xavfini kamaytirish mumkin.
Mazkur tadqiqot 14-18 yosh oralig‘idagi 100 nafar o‘smir o‘rtasida o‘tkazildi.
Tadqiqotning asosiy maqsadi ijtimoiy identifikatsiya inqirozining o‘smirlar xulq-atvoriga,
ayniqsa, jinoyatchilikka moyilligiga qanday ta’sir qilishini aniqlash edi. Ishtirokchilarning
jinsiy taqsimoti quyidagicha: 56% erkaklar, 44% ayollar.
1. Identifikatsiya jarayoni bo‘yicha natijalar:
35% ishtirokchilar identifikatsiya diffuziyasi holatida bo‘lib, ular hali kim
ekanliklari va qanday hayot yo‘li tanlashlari kerakligini bilishmaydi.
40% ishtirokchilar identifikatsiya inqirozi (moratorium) bosqichida – ya’ni, ular faol
izlanishda, lekin hali aniq qarorga kelmagan.
15% ishtirokchilar majburan qabul qilingan identifikatsiya holatida bo‘lib, ular asosan
ota-onasi yoki jamiyat ularga tanlab bergan yo‘nalish bo‘ylab harakat qilishayotganini
bildirishgan.
Faqatgina 10% ishtirokchilar muvaffaqiyatli identifikatsiyaga erishgan – ya’ni, o‘z
yo‘lini aniq belgilagan va ijtimoiy o‘zini anglashi mustahkam bo‘lgan.
2. Ijtimoiy institutlarga ishonch va bog‘liqlik bo‘yicha natijalar:
45% ishtirokchilar oilalari yoki ta’lim muassasalari tomonidan yetarli darajada qo‘llabquvvatlanayotganini aytishgan.
30% ishtirokchilar jamiyat va ta’lim muassasalariga ishonchsizlik bildirgan, ularning
fikricha, ijtimoiy institutlar ularga yetarli yordam ko‘rsatmaydi.
25% ishtirokchilar esa oilaviy muhit va jamiyat tomonidan to‘liq qo‘llabquvvatlanmaganini ta’kidlashgan.
3. Jinoyatchilikka moyillik bo‘yicha natijalar:
25% o‘smirlar avval huquqbuzarlik yoki deviant xatti-harakatga aralashganini
bildirgan (masalan, janjal, mayda o‘g‘irlik, qoidabuzarlik).
20% ishtirokchilar do‘stlari orasida jinoyat sodir etganlar borligini tasdiqlagan.
15% ishtirokchilar do‘stlari tomonidan noqonuniy harakatlarga undanganini
bildirgan.

Xulosa: Mazkur tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, o‘smirlarning ijtimoiy
identifikatsiya jarayoni va jinoyatchilikka moyilligi o‘rtasida bevosita bog‘liqlik mavjud.
Identifikatsiya inqirozi holatida bo‘lgan yoki o‘z shaxsiy yo‘nalishini hali aniq belgilamagan
yoshlar deviant xatti-harakatlarga ko‘proq moyil bo‘ladilar. Ayniqsa, ijtimoiy institutlar – oila,
maktab va jamiyat tomonidan yetarlicha qo‘llab-quvvatlanmagan o‘smirlar jinoyatchilikka
ko‘proq moyillik bildirgan.
Tadqiqot natijalari asosida quyidagi asosiy xulosalarga kelish mumkin:
1.O‘smirlarning o‘z shaxsiy identifikatsiyasini shakllantirish jarayoni ularning
kelajakdagi xulq-atvorini belgilaydi.
O‘z kelajagini aniq belgilay olmagan yoki atrof-muhitning bosimi ostida bo‘lgan
yoshlar deviant xatti-harakatlarga ko‘proq moyil bo‘ladilar, O‘z kasb tanlovi va hayot yo‘nalishi
bo‘yicha mustaqil qaror qabul qilgan o‘smirlar esa ijtimoiy faol va qonunbuzarlikdan yiroq
bo‘lishadi, Ijtimoiy institutlarga ishonch va ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlashning yetishmovchiligi
jinoyatchilikka moyillikni oshiradi. Ota-onasi, maktab yoki jamiyat tomonidan e’tibordan

chetda qolgan o‘smirlar o‘zlarini jamiyatdan begonalashgan deb his qilishadi, Bu holat ularda
agressivlik, deviant xatti-harakat va jinoyatchilikka moyillikni kuchaytiradi.
2. Do‘stlar va ijtimoiy muhitning o‘smirlar xulq-atvoriga kuchli ta’siri mavjud.
Jinoyatchilikka moyillik bildirganlarning aksariyati ularning atrofidagi do‘stlari yoki
tanishlari orasida huquqbuzarlik qilgan shaxslar borligini tasdiqlagan, Demak, o‘smirning kim
bilan muloqot qilishi, uning kelajakdagi xulq-atvoriga bevosita ta’sir qiladi.
Umuman olganda, o‘smirlarning ijtimoiy identifikatsiyasi va ularning jinoyatchilikka
moyilligi o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Identifikatsiya jarayonida yuzaga
keladigan inqiroz va ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlashning yetishmovchiligi yoshlarning noto‘g‘ri
yo‘l tanlashiga olib kelishi mumkin. Shu sababli, o‘smirlarning ijtimoiy muhitini yaxshilash,
ularni o‘z qobiliyatlari va qiziqishlariga mos ravishda yo‘naltirish, shuningdek, ijtimoiy
institutlar tomonidan mustahkam qo‘llab-quvvatlash tizimini yaratish zarur.
Faqatgina
kompleks yondashuv orqali yoshlarning to‘g‘ri identifikatsiyasini shakllantirib, ularni sog‘lom
va mas’uliyatli shaxs sifatida voyaga yetkazish mumkin.

Kirish.O‘zbekiston Respublikasida ta’lim va ijtimoiy sohalarning barqaror o‘sishi va
rivojlanishini ta’minlashga qaratilgan davlat dasturlari doirasida yoshlarni qo‘llab-quvvatlash
va yetuk mutaxassis kadrlar sifatida yetishtirish masalalari hozirgi kundagi muhim yo‘nalishlar
sifatida e’tirof etilmoqda. Bu o‘z navbatida O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat
Mirziyoevning “Erkin va farovon demokratik O‘zbekiston davlatini birgalikda barpo etamiz”
nomli asarida keltirilgan davlatimiz fuqarolarini milliy vatanparvarlik ruhida tarbiyalash va
milliy qadriyatlarga sodiqligini oshirishga qaratilgan ustuvor vazifalarga mos talaba yoshlarni
zamon talablariga muvofiq yangicha ishlash va fikrlashga, izlanish, tashabbuskorlik va
tadbirkorlik madaniyatini rivojlantirishning hozirgi kun ijtimoiy-siyosiy omillari qatorida
keltirish mumkin. SHu bois, talaba-yoshlarning kreativ qobiliyatlarini rivojlantirish orqali
ularning ta’lim va ishlab chiqarish o‘rtasidagi faolligini oshirishning muhim yo‘nalish sifatida
qarash mumkin.
Adabiyotlar tahlili. So`nggi yillarda etakchi xorijiy mamlakatlarning ta’lim tizimida
talabalarda bo`lajak mutaxassislar sifatida kreativlik sifatlarini shakllantirish masalasiga
alohida, jiddiy e’tibor qaratilmoqda. Buni Bronson, Merriyman (2010 y.), Ken Robinson (2007
y.), Fisher, Frey (2008 y.), Begetto, Kaufman (2013 y.), Ali (2011 y.), Treffinger (2008 y.) va
boshqalar tomonidan olib borilgan ko`plab tadqiqotlar, ularning natijalarida ko`rish mumkin.
Shaxsning kreativ potensiali va ijodiy xulq-atvori (va uning mahsulotlari) o'rtasidagi
munosabatlar quyidagicha ifodalanishi mumkin. Ijodiy xatti-harakatlarning samaradorligini
bashorat qilishga imkon beradigan shaxsiy xususiyatlar shaxsning kreativ potensiali sifatida
talqin qilinishi mumkin. Ikkinchisi samarali ijodiy xatti-harakatlar uchun shart bo'lib xizmat
qilishi mumkin bo'lgan shaxsiy xususiyat yoki shaxsiy profil sifatida belgilanadi. E'tibor bering,
shaxsga nisbatan "ijodiy" atamasi bu erda ko'proq metafora sifatida qaralishi kerak: shaxsning
o'zida deyarli hech qanday ijodiy narsa yo'q. Ammo "ijodiy" atamasi ijodiy xatti-harakatlar
mahsulotlari bilan bevosita bog'liq. Ijodiy xatti-harakatlar, masalan, ishlab chiqarilgan
mahsulotlar soni bilan ko'rsatilishi mumkin. Tomas Edison 1093 ta patent oldi. Pablo Pikasso
20000 dan ortiq rasm, rasm va haykaltaroshlik asarlarining muallifi. Sebastyan Bax 1000 dan
ortiq musiqiy asarlar yaratgan. Eyzenck (1995) psixotizmning o'rtacha darajasi ijodiy xulq-atvor
mahsulotlari bilan bog'liqligini ko'rsatdi. Ammo psixotizm o'ziga xos "ijodiy" deb
hisoblanmaydigan shaxsiy xususiyatdir. Ijodkorlik bilan bir qatorda, psixotizm tajovuzkorlik,
sovuqqonlik, egosentrizm, empatiya qila olmaslik va o'zini boshqasining o'rniga qo'ya
olmaslik, befarqlik, ehtiyotkorlik kabi shaxsiy xususiyatlarni tavsiflaydi. Kreativ potensial
bilish jarayoniga уо‘naltirilgan ijodkorlik bilan chambarchas bog‘liq. Shaxsning kreativ
potensiali an’anaviy tafakkur yuritishdan farqli ravishda quyidagilarda namoyon bo‘ladi:
tafakkuming tezkorligi va egiluvchanligi; yangi g‘oyalami yaratish qobiliyati; bir qolipda
fikrlamaslik; o‘ziga xoslik; tashabbuskorlik; noaniqlikka toqat qilish; zakovatli bo'lishdir.[1]

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Tadqiqot metodologiyasi.Kreativlik potensialiga ega bo‘lishi uchun kasbiy faoliyatida
quyidagilarga e’tiborini qaratishi zarur:
♦ kasbiy faoliyatiga ijodiy yondoshish;
♦ yangi-yangi g ‘oyalami yaratishda faollik ko‘rsatish;
♦ ilg‘or yutuq va tajribalarni mustaqil o‘rganish;
♦ hamkasblar bilan yutuqlar xususida fikr almashish.
Har bir mutaxassisning o‘zini o ‘zi rivojlantirishi va o ‘zini o ‘zi namoyon eta olishi
bevosita uning kreativlik qobiliyatiga egaligi bilan bog‘liq. Odatda mutaxassislarning kreativlik
qobiliyatiga ega bo‘lishlari muammolarni hal qilishga intilish, ilmiy-tadqiqot ishlari yoki ilmiy
loyihalarni amalga oshirish va o‘zaro ijodiy hamkorlikka erishishlari orqali ta’minlanadi.
Shaxs o ‘z-o‘zidan ijodkor b o ‘lib qolmaydi. Uning ijodkorlik qobiliyati
ma’Ium
vaqt ichida izchil o‘qib-o‘rganish, o‘z ustida ishlash orqali shakllantiriladi va u asta-sekin
takomillashib, rivojlanib boradi. Bo‘lajak mutaxassislarning kreativlik qobiliyatiga ega
bo‘lishlari uchun talabalik yillarida poydevor qo‘yiladi va kasbiy faoliyatni tashkil etishda izchil
rivojlantirib boriladi. Bunda mutaxassisning o ‘zini o‘zi ijodiy faoliyatga yo‘naltirishi va bu
faoliyatni samarali tashkil eta olishi muhim ahamiyatga ega. [2] Mutaxassis ijodiy faoliyatni
tashkil etishda muammoii masalalarni yechish, muammoli vaziyatlarni tahlil qilish, shuningdek,
ahamiyatli ijod mahsulotlarini yaratishga alohida e’tibor qaratishi zarur.
Muammoli masala va vaziyatlarni hal qilar ekan, mutaxassisning masala yechimini
topishga ijodiy yondoshishi unda hissiy-irodaviy sifatlaming rivojlanishiga yordam beradi.
Shaxs o‘z oldiga muammoli masalalarni qo‘yish orqali mavjud bilimlari va hayotiy tajribalariga
zid bo‘lgan dalillar bilan to‘qnash keladi. Buning natijasida o‘z ustida ishlash, mustaqil o‘qibo‘rganishga nisbatan ehtiyoj sezadi.
Barcha mutaxassislarni pedagoglar o‘qitadi va ular kreativlikni rivojlantirishga turtki
beruvchi omil hisoblanadi. Pedagogning ilmiy-tadqiqot ishlari va ilmiy yoki ijodiy loyihalarni
amalga oshirishi unda kreativlik potensialini yanada rivojlantiradi. [3] Natijada pedagog: ijodiy
fikrlashga odatlanadi; ilmiy-tadqiqot faoliyatini olib borish ko‘nikmalarini puxta o‘zlashtiradi;
pedagogika yoki mutaxassislik fani yutuqlari hamda ilg‘or tajribalardan foydalanish
imkoniyatlarini mustaqil tahlil qiladi; pedagogik jamoa tomonidan olib borilayotgan ilmiy
tadqiqot va ijodiy loyihalarni bajarishda faol ishtirok etadi.
Tahlil va natijalar.Shu o‘rinda pedagoglarda namoyon bo‘ladigan kreativlik sifatlarini
rivojlantirish yuzasidan Devid Lyuis tomonidan amaliy ko‘rsatmalar ishlab chiqilgan. [4]
1.Pedagogning maxsus bilimlarni egallaganligi, o‘z predmetini ilmiy darajada bilishi.
Mazkur fanning zamonaviy yutuqlari va istiqboli yo‘nalishlarini va rivojlanishi darajasini
bilish. Ushbu tarmoq ishlab chiqarishning bugungi kundagi yutuqlarini bilish. O‘z sohasi
bo‘yicha davlat standartlaridan xabardorlik.
2.Oliy o‘quv yurti bo‘yicha va predmetiga ko‘ra, qo‘llaniladigan darsliklarni bilish.
Predmetni o'qitishning maqsad va vazifalarini bilish. Mutaxassislar tayyorlash tizimida o‘z
mutaxassisligi qanday ahamiyat kasb etishini bilish.
73

3.Maxsus bilish, ko‘nikma. Aniq bir kasbni mukammal bilishi. Mutaxassisning
pedagogik va psixologik tayyorgarligi. Muvaffaqiyatli kasbiy faoliyat uchun zarur bo‘lgan
pedagogika va psixologiya sohalari bo‘yicha zarur bo‘lgan bilim va ko‘nikmalari.
4.Pedagogik-psixologik bilimlar. Oliy maktab pedagogika va psixologiya bilimlari,
faoliyat nazariyasi bo‘yicha bilimlar, oliy kasbiy ta’limning zamonaviy konsepsiyalari
to‘g‘risida bilimlar, o‘z mutaxassisiligi bo‘yicha bilimlarga ega bo‘lish.
5.Pedagogik bilimlar: diagnostika; prognostik; loyihalash; konstruktivlik;
kommunikativlik; tashkilotchilik; tahlil qilish.
6.Diagnostik bilim. shaxslarning bilim, ko‘nikma, tajriba va kompetensiyasi tizimida
dastlabki, o‘rta va yakuniy darajasini aniqlab berish, xodimlar guruhida vaziyatlarni aniqlash,
xodimning umumadaniy va tarbiya darajasini aniqlash va boshqalar.
7.Mutaxassisning prognostik bilishi. Oldindan aytib berishi, biron-bir vazifani aniq
belgilab olib, uni yechish shakllarini aniqlash, ishlarning rejalarini tuzib olish, ish jarayonida
xodimlar uchun yuzaga keladigan qiyinchiliklar va xatolarni oldindan bilish va boshqalar.
8.Mutaxassisning konstruktiv bilishi. Ish jarayonlarini ilmiy asosda qurish, tashkil etish,
samarador kasbiy tarbiya texnologiyalari, metodlari, shakllari, usullari va vositalirini tanlash
hamda qollash, amaliy ishlarini tashkil qilish va boshqarish, xodimlarning ijodiy ishlarini
faollashtirish va boshqalar.
9.Mutaxassisning kommunikativligi. Xodimlar bilan maqsadga muvofiq munosabatlar
o‘rnatish, ular bilan munosabatlarda individual va o‘ziga xos yondoshuvlami topish, ish
davomida ijobiy-ruhiy muhitni tashkil qilish, xodimlar xulq-atvorini boshqara bilish, o‘zini
xayolan xodim o‘rniga qo‘yib ko‘ra bilish, xodimni ezgu ishlarga qiziqtirish, faoliyatning eng
yaxshi shakllarini izlab topish. 10.Mutaxassisning tashkilotchilik qobiliyati. Xodimlar ish
faoliyatini tashkil etish, turli kasbga yo‘naltirilgan va boshqa ruhdagi tadbirlarni tashkil etish va
boshqalar. 11.Mutaxassisning tahliliy bilishi. Kasbiy faoliyatidagi kamchiliklar va yutuqlar
yuzaga kelish sabablari hamda xodimlarning tajribalarini tahlil qilish.
Biz tilga olgan mutaxassislarga qo‘yiladigan talablar ichida uning kasbiy
kompetensiyasini takomillashtirish va davlat standartlari talablariga javob bera olish masalasi
ham eng muhim vazifa hisoblanadi.
Tomas Edison “Kreativlik - g‘ayriixtiyoriy jarayon”, deydi. Lekin har kuni ko‘plab
mutaxassislar muammolarga duch keladi, noodatiy yechim topishga zaruriyat sezadi. Ular mana
shu g‘ayriixtiyoriy jarayonni ixtiyoriylashtirishi mumkinmi? Tabiatda yangi fikrlarni yuzaga
keltiruvchi “sehrli tayoqcha” yo‘q, biroq har qanday mutaxassisning kreativ o‘ylashiga
ko‘maklashadigan ko‘plab usullar mavjud. Buning uchun ijodiy fikrlashga vaqt ajratish, ijodiy
salohiyatni anglash lozim. [5]
XULOSA: Jorj Bernard Shou shunday deydi: “Ko‘pchilik yiliga ikki-uch marta
o‘ylaydi. Mening butun dunyoga mashhurligim sababi - haftada bir yoki ikki marta
o‘ylaganim”dir. Demak, xayolga kelgan yangi fikrlarni e’tiborsiz qoldirmaslik, o‘ylash uchun
imkon yaratish muhim. Ijodkorlik chegarasini belgilash xam muxim.[6]

Uolt Disney ko‘ngilochar sohada o ‘z sanoatini yaratgan, animatsion multfilmlari bilan
butun dunyoga tanilgan shaxs. U dunyoga mashhur personajlarini yaratishda kreativlikning uch
fazasi - xayolparast, realist, tanqidchi obrazidan foydalanadi. Ya’ni, xayolparast rolida hech
qanday chegarasiz xayol suradi, fantaziya yaratadi. Bu jarayonda u Baxning “Tokkata, fuga re
minar” musiqasini eshitishini aytgan. Xayolida obrazlar yaratilgandan keyin uni reallik bilan
uyg‘unlashtiradi. Personaj qanday harakatlanadi, qanday gapiradi - barchasini konstruktor
sifatida jonlantiradi, reallashtiradi. Shundan keyin xayolparast va realist ishini tanqidchi ko‘rib
chiqadi. Tanqidchi “filtr” vazifasini bajaradi. Uolt Disneyning yutug‘i xayolparast, realist,
tanqidchini bitta shaxsda jam lay olganidir. Odatiy fikrlovchilarda ularning bittasi ustuvorlik
qiladi.[7]
Har qanday davlatning jahon hamjamiyatida tutgan nufuzi uning intellektual kamoloti
bilan belgilanadi. Mamlakat ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy taraqqiyotida iste’dodli, fidoyi ijodkor yoshlar
muhim o‘rin tutadi. Muammoni o‘rtaga tashlash, uni har tomonlama o‘rganish, muammoning
kelib chiqish sabab va oqibatlarini mushohada qilish, muammo ustida mustaqil fikr yuritish,
muammoni yechishning turli imkoniyatlarini tahlil qilish va uni yechishning eng maqbul
yo‘lini topishga qodir bo‘lishlari uchun ularda kreativ potensialni rivojlantirish muhim
ahamiyat kasb etadi.

Kirish. O‘zbekiston Respublikasida maktabgacha ta’limni rivojlantirish va samarali
faoliyat ko‘rsatishiga qaratilgan qator normativ-huquqiy hujjatlar qabul qilindi hamda kompleks
chora-tadbirlar amalga oshirildi.
Hozirgi kunda mamlakatimizda amalga oshirilayotgan maktabgacha ta’lim tizimini qayta
ko‘rib chiqish masalasi davlat siyosati darajasiga ko‘tarilib, bu borada katta ishlar amalga
oshirilmoqda.
Prezidentimiz Shavkat Mirziyoyev мaktabgacha ta’limni boshqarishning zamonaviy
mexanizmlarini joriy etish, tarbiya va o‘quv jarayonini takomillashtirish, maktabgacha ta’lim
muassasalarini yuqori malakali mutaxassislar bilan to‘ldirish, ularning infratuzilmasi va
moddiy-texnik jihozlanishini yaxshilash maqsadida shunday fikr bildirganlar.
-Maktabgacha ta’lim tizimini takomillashtirishni har tomonlama puxta o‘ylab amalga
oshirmasak, butun ta’lim tizimida sifat o‘zgarishiga erishishimiz, ta’limning uzluksizligini
ta‘minlashimiz qiyin bo‘ladi , deya ta’kidlaydi.
Maktabgacha yoshdagi bolani to‘liq tarbiyalash oila, mahalliy jamoatchilik va MTT
o‘rtasida yaqin hamkorlik sharoitida amalga oshiriladi.
Ma’lumki, oila bolalarni ijtimoiylashishi uchun birinchi va eng muhim institutdir. “Ilk
qadam” davlat o‘quv dasturini amalga oshirishda MTTlariga oila va mahalliy jamoatchiliklar
bilan yaqindan hamkorlik qilish vazifalarni qo‘ydi.
MTTlarining asosiy vazifalaridan biri
-bolalar tarbiyasida oilalarga professional pedagogik-psixologik yordam ko‘rsatishdan
iborat bo‘lib, shu bilan birgalikda uning o‘rnini to‘liq egallamasdan uning ta’lim funktsiyalarini
to‘ldirish va to‘liq amalga oshirishdan iborat.
Har bir yosh davrida bola turli faoliyat bosqichlarini bosib o‘tadi va hayotiy tajribasi
ortib boradi. 6-7 yoshli bolada o‘yin faoliyati ustunlik qilib, ta’lim faoliyatiga oid motivlar,
ehtiyoj va qiziqishlar tarkib topa boshlaydi. Bolaning maktab ta’limiga tayyorligi tushunchasi
ularning jismoniy, psixologik, aqliy, axloqiy tayyorligi bilan belgilanadi.
Xabarimiz borki, ayirim hududlarida ko‘p bola maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotiga
qatnamaydi. Bolaning asosiy vaqti oila muhitida bo‘lganligi uchun ota-onaning bolani
maktabga tayyorlashdagi roli beqiyosdir. Har bir ota-onaning vazifasi farzandining ichki
imkoniyatlaridan kelib chiqib,tabiiy uy sharoiti muhitidagi voqea-hodisalar jarayonida
farzandiga o‘qishning aqliy mehnat ekanligini, diqqatini, irodasini ishga solishi kerakligini,
bundan tashqari o‘z xulqini idora etishi, xatti-harakati uchun javob berishi lozimligini anglatishi
zarur. Oiladagi sog’lom muhit odamiylik, insonparvarlik munosabatlari farzandlarning ruhiy
dunyosiga ijobiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Adabiyotlar tahlili. Ota-onaning o‘zaro yaxshi munosabati, mehribonligi, g‘amxo‘rligi
oiladagi farzandlarning munosabatlari to‘g'ri shakllanishiga yordam beradi. Bolalarni
tarbiyalashni to‘g‘ri hal qilinishi tarbiya ishining qo‘yilishiga kompleks yondishishga,
maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotining oila va maxallaning to‘liq o‘zaro xamkorligi va harakatining
birligiga bog’liq. Mahalla, maktabgacha taьlim tashkiloti va oilaning o‘zaro aloqasi bola

tarbiyasi masalasida tajriba almashinib turish imkoniyatini yaratadi. Maktabgacha yoshdagi
bola maktab ta‘limiga tayyor bo‘lishi uchun undan jismonan sog‘lomlik, nutq va tafakkurning
maьlum doirada rivojlanganligi, shaxsida ma’naviy va axloqiy xususiyatlarning yetarli
shaklanganligi, maktab hayoti haqida tegishli tasavvurlarga ega bo‘lishi talab etiladi.
Mahalla, ota-onalar bilan maktabgacha ta’lim tashkiloti xodimlarining birgalikdagi
faoliyatini tashkil etish birgalikda yillik reja tuzishdan boshlanadi. Oila va yosh bolalarni
parvarishlashning maktabgacha yoshdagi bolalar shaxsi rivojlanishiga ta’siri printsipial
ravishda pedagoglar, jamoat tashkilotlari va oilalarning birgalikdagi faoliyati orqali amalga
oshiriladi, bunda tarbiya bilan shug‘ullanuvchi barcha shaxslar, tashkilotlar, jamoat tashkilotlari
birgalikda harakat qilishlari, kelishilgan talablarni bir-birlariga ko‘rsatishi, bir birlariga yordam
berishi, pedagogik ta'sirni to‘ldirish va kuchaytirishi kerak. Agar bunday birdamlik va sa’yharakatlarni muvofiqlashtirishga erishilmasa, unda muvaffaqiyatga erishish qiyin.
V.A.Suxomlinskiy, tarbiya va rivojlanish vazifalari bolalar bog‘chasi oila bilan aloqani
saqlab, uni o‘z ishiga jalb qilgan taqdirdagina muvaffaqiyatli hal qilinishi mumkinligini
ta’kidlaydi.
Tahlil va natijalar. MTT bilan oila va jamoatchilikning o‘zaro hamkorligini tashkil etish
quyidagi asosiy printsiplarga asoslanadi:
1. Tarbiyachilar va ota-onalar o‘rtasidagi do‘stona muloqot Ushbu printsip muloqotga
ijobiy munosabatni bildiradi va ilk bolalik ta’limi tarbiyachilarining ota-onalar bilan olib
boradigan barcha ishlariga asoslanadi.
Tarbiyachilar har kuni ota-onalar bilan muloqot qilishadi va bu butun oilaning
maktabgacha ta’limga munosabati qanday bo‘lishiga bog‘liq. Har kuni tarbiyachilar va otaonalar o‘rtasidagi xayrixohlik aloqasi alohida o‘tkaziladigan tadbirdan ko‘proq narsani
anglatadi.
Ushbu tamoyil muloqotga ijobiy munosabatni nazarda tutadi va tarbiyachilar butun
faoliyati davomida ota-onalar bilan ishlashi uchun zamin yaratadi.
Tarbiyachilarning ota-onalar kategoriyalari bilan muloqotida talabchan ohang mos emas.
2. Individual yondashuv
Hamkorlikning ushbu printsipi nafaqat bolalar bilan ishlashda, balki ota-onalar bilan
ishlashda muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Ota-onalar bilan muloqotda bo‘lgan tarbiyachilar
vaziyatni, ota-onalarning kayfiyatini his qilishlari kerak. Bu yerda tarbiyachilarning otaonalarga ishonchi, hamdardligi va birgalikda muayyan vaziyatda bolaga qanday yordam
berishini o‘ylash qobiliyati va pedagogik qobiliyati muhim ahamiyatga ega.
3. Murabbiylik emas, hamkorlik
Aksariyat zamonaviy onalar va otalar ziyoli, bilimli va albatta, o‘z farzandlarini qanday
tarbiyalash kerakligini yaxshi bilishadi. Shuning uchun bugungi kunda pedagogik bilimlarni
o‘rgatish va oddiy targ’ib qilish pozitsiyasi ijobiy natijalarga olib kelishi mumkin emas. Og‘ir
pedagogik vaziyatlarda oilaga o‘zaro yordam va qo‘llab quvvatlash muhitini yaratish, oilaviy
78

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

muammolarni tushunish va yechimini topishda MTT jamoasining oila muammolarini hal
qilishda samimiy yordam bermoqchi ekanligini e'tirof qilishi kerak.
4. Dinamiklik
MTT bugungi kunda oddiy faoliyat ko‘rsatish rejimida emas, balki rivojlanish rejimida
bo‘lishi kerak, mobil tizim bo‘lishi, ota-onalarning ijtimoiy tarkibidagi o‘zgarishlarga, ularning
ta’lim ehtiyojlariga va ta'limga bo‘lgan talablariga tezda javob berishi kerak. Shundan kelib
chiqqan holda MTTning oila bilan ishlash shakli va yo‘nalishlari o‘zgarishi kerak.
5. Ochiqlik
Maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotining oila uchun ochiqligi – har bir ota-onaga uning bolasi
qanday yashayotganini va rivojlanishini bilish va ko‘rish imkoniyatini yaratib berishdan
iboratdir. Bu muammoli vaziyatlarning paydo bo‘lishining oldini olishda muhim ahamiyatga
ega bo‘lib, tarbiyachilar va ota-onalar o‘rtasida shaxsiy aloqalarni o‘rnatish, har kuni otaonalarga bolaning kunni qanday o‘tkazganligi, nimani o‘rganganligi, qanday yutuqlarga
erishganligi haqida ma'lumot berib borish kerak. Shuning asosida ota-onalarning psixologik
qobiliyatini qo‘llab-quvvatlash zamonaviy davrning eng dolzarb vazifasiga aylandi.
Ota-onalar va tarbiyachilarning birgalikdagi faoliyati bizga bolalarni tarbiyalashda
mavjud muammolarini birgalikda aniqlash va ularni hal qilish imkonini beradi. Bunday
hamkorlik quyidagi jihatlarga yordam beradi:
- ikkala tomonning ta’lim olishi imkoniyatlarini o‘rganish;
-yutuqlar va muammolarni tarbiyachi bilan birgalikda aniqlash (bolaning rivojlanish
xaritasi ma’lumotlari asosida);
- o‘qitish, ta’lim va rivojlanishning dolzarb muammolari nuqtai-nazaridan bolalar va
kattalarning birgalikdagi loyihaviy faoliyati.
Yuqoridagi hamkorlik yondashuvidan kelib chiqqan holda, MTTlari oilalar va mahalliy
jamoatchilik bilan birgalikda MTTning maqsad va vazifalarini belgilaydi.
Maqsadlar:
- Ota-onalar va mahalliy jamoatchilik bilan o‘zaro munosabatlar uchun qulay muhitni
yaratish.
- Ota-onalar va mahalliy jamoatchilik bilan o‘zaro munosabatlarni o‘rnatish.
- Ota-onalarning ta'lim jarayonida, turli qo‘shimcha tadbirlarda ishtirok etishini
faollashtirish.
Vazifalar:
- Ota-onalar bilan hamkorlik aloqalarini o‘rnatish va ularning psixologik va pedagogik
mahoratini qo‘llab-quvvatlash.
-Bolalar bilan o‘yin sheriklik munosabatlarini o‘rnatish va ularning maktabgacha
ta'lim tashkilotlarida muvaffaqiyatli rivojlanishiga yordam berish.
Oila bilan o‘zaro munosabat shakllari maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotlarining o‘zaro
hamkorligi kamdan-kam hollarda darhol yuzaga keladi. Bu sabr-toqatni, tanlangan maqsadga
79

qat’iy rioya qilishni va ota-onalar bilan hamkorlik qilishning yangi usullarini doimiy ravishda
izlashni talab qiladigan uzoq jarayon, uzoq davom etadigan mashaqqatli mehnatdir.
Ota-onalar va tarbiyachilarning o‘zaro hamkorligi va bir-biri bilan ma’lumot
almashish uchun imkoniyat yaratadigan faoliyatning turli shakllari va usullari mavjud:
- umumiy va guruh ota-onalar yig‘ilishlari;
- ota-onalar ishtirokidagi mashg‘ulotlar;
-tashrif kunlari;
- ota-onalar qo‘mitasi bilan ishlash;
- mavzularni rivojlantirish muhitini birgalikda yaratish;
- fotoko‘rgazmalarni birgalikda yaratish;
- ochiq eshik kunlari;
- seminarlar;
- amaliy mashg‘ulotlar;
- birgalikdagi ekskursiyalar;
- ta’tilga tayyorgarlik ko‘rish va uni o‘tkazishda ota-onalarning ishtiroki;
- mashg‘ulotlar;
- ota-onalar bilan o‘tkazilgan bolalar asarlarining ko‘rgazmalari;
- konferentsiyalar;
- davra suhbatlari va boshqalar.
Oila bilan ishlashning turli shakllaridan foydalanish ota-onalarning maktabgacha
tarbiya tashkilotiga joylashishi va ishonchini uyg‘otishga imkon beradi.
MTT mutaxassislari oila bilan an’anaviy o‘zaro munosabatlarning pedagogik
imkoniyatlaridan to‘liq foydalanishga harakat qilmoqdalar va ota-onalar va umuman mahalliy
jamoatchilik bilan hamkorlikning yangi shakllarini izlamoqdalar.
Pedagog bu yoki boshqa ish turini rejalashtirayotganda har doim zamonaviy otaonalar, shuningdek, doimiy izlanish, o‘z-o‘zini rivojlantirish va hamkorlikka tayyor bo‘lgan
zamonaviy odamlar haqidagi fikrlardan kelib chiqishi kerak. Shuni hisobga olib, o‘zaro ta’sir
shakllariga quyidagi talablarni tanlashingiz mumkin:
● o‘ziga xoslik;
● talab;
● interaktivlik.
Maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotlarining oila va mahalliy jamoatchilik bilan hamkorlik
aloqalarini o‘rnatish zaruriyati hozirgi paytda dolzarb bo‘lib qolmoqda.Olib borilgan ilmiy
izlanish va tajribalar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, tarbiyachilar, oilalar va jamoat a’zolari o‘rtasidagi
kuchli hamkorlik bolalarning rivojlanishi va ta’lim olishiga ijobiy hissa qo‘shadi. Shaxsga
yo‘naltirilgan ta’lim ushbu hamkorlikni maktabgacha ta'lim tashkilotlarida berilayotgan
ta’limni kuchaytirish va kengaytirish, shuningdek, uyda va jamiyatda sodir bo‘layotgan qiziqish
va ta’limni rivojlantirish uchun zarur degan ishonchga asoslanadi.
80

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Hamkorlik deganda, ikkala tomonning ham huquq va majburiyatlari mavjud bo‘lib,
bir-birlarini layoqatli deb bilishlari va bir-birlarini sherik sifatida qadrlashlari nazarda tutiladi.
Hamkorlik tarbiyachi bilan ishlaydigan oila va jamoa qadriyatlari, turmush tarzi, o‘ziga xos
xususiyatlarini tan olish va ularni qadrlashi, shuningdek, bolalarning o‘qishi va rivojlanishiga
hissa qo‘shadigan ko‘plab muhim usullarni qadrlashlarini talab qiladi.
Maktabgacha yoshdagi bolalar bilan ishlaydigan tarbiyachilar farzandlar oilada va
jamoada nimalarni o‘rganayotganiga tayanib, ta'lim olish imkoniyatlarini kengaytiradi.
“Bolaning har tomonlama rivojlanishini ta’minlash uchun maktabgacha ta’lim
tashkiloti ota-onalar bilan o‘zaro munosabatlarining quyidagi shakllaridan foydalanishlari
mumkin:
● maktabgacha ta’lim tashkiloti ota-onalarning umidlarini hisobga olish;
● ota-onalarga erta rivojlanish masalalari bo‘yicha ma’lumot berish;
● ota-onalarni o‘quv-tarbiya jarayonida faol ishtirok etishga jalb qilish;
● ota-onalarning maktabgacha ta’im tashkilotlari faoliyatida ishtirok etish
tashabbusini qo‘llab-quvvatlash.
So‘nggi ikki yil ichida, O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti va Vazirlar
Mahkamasining maktabgacha ta’lim tizimini takomillashtirish to‘g‘risida qarorlari
qabul qilinganidan so‘ng, oila va maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotlari o‘rtasidagi o‘zaro
munosabatlarning yangi falsafasi ishlab chiqila boshlandi. Bu ota-onalar bolalarni
tarbiyalash va rivojlantirish uchun javobgardir va boshqa barcha ijtimoiy institutlar ushbu
faoliyatni qo‘llab-quvvatlashga va to‘ldirishga chaqiriladi degan fikrga asoslanadi.
Xulosa. Maktabgacha ta’lim tashkiloti oilani qo‘llab-quvvatlovchi ijtimoiy tashkilot
sifatida bolani tarbiyalash, o‘qitish va rivojlantirishga yordam beradi. Mavjud ijtimoiy-madaniy
va iqtisodiy sharoitda oila va jamoat tashkilotlari bilan o‘zaro munosabatlar mahalla fuqarolar
yig'ini faoliyatining muhim yo‘nalishi hisoblanadi.
Ma’lum bir bosqichda oila, ilk bolalikni parvarish qilish maktabgacha ta’lim tashkilotlari
va mahalliy jamoatchilik asosiy o‘quv, tarbiyaviy va rivojlanayotgan
Faqat ular bir-biri bilan uyg'un holda kichkina insonning katta dunyoga qadam
tashlashlari uchun eng yaxshi sharoitlarni yaratadilar.
Jamiyat va oilaviy ta’lim o‘rtasidagi munosabatlar g‘oyasi bir qator me’yoriy hujjatlarda,
shu jumladan “O‘zbekiston Respublikasining 2030 yilgacha maktabgacha ta’lim tizimini
rivojlantirish kontseptsiyasi” va “Umumiy tipdagi davlat va nodavlat maktabgacha ta'lim
tashkilotlari to‘g‘risidagi Nizom”da o‘z aksini topgan.

on adolescent suicidal behavior. It analyzes aspects such as socio-economic conditions,
education levels, and gender differences, as well as their interaction with climate change. The
study explores how stress and psychological pressure resulting from climate change may affect
adolescents' mental health. The findings of this research could aid in developing effective
strategies to reduce suicide rates among adolescents and improve their mental well-being.
Keywords: Climate change, demographic factors, suicidal behavior, adolescents, socioeconomic conditions, gender differences, mental health, stress, psychological pressure
KIRISH.
Iqlim o‘zgarishi va demografik o‘zgarishlar global miqyosda insonlar hayotiga jiddiy
ta’sir ko‘rsatmoqda. Bu omillar o‘smirlar orasida suitsidal xulqning ortishiga ham sabab bo‘lishi
mumkin. Ushbu maqolada biz iqlim o‘zgarishi va demografik omillarning o‘smirlar suitsidal
xulqiga qanday ta’sir qilishini tahlil qilamiz.
Iqlim o‘zgarishi, tabiiy ofatlar va ularning ko‘payishi insonlar, ayniqsa, o‘smirlar
psixologiyasiga jiddiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Tabiiy ofatlar natijasida uy-joylarini yo‘qotish,
yaqinlaridan ayrilish, kelajakka ishonchning yo‘qolishi kabi holatlar o‘smirlarda stress va
depressiyani kuchaytiradi. Bu esa suitsidal xulqning rivojlanishiga olib kelishi mumkin.
Demografik o‘zgarishlar, jumladan, migratsiya, urbanizatsiya va aholining yosh
tarkibidagi o‘zgarishlar o‘smirlar hayotiga ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Migratsiya natijasida o‘smirlar
yangi muhitga moslashishda qiyinchiliklarga duch keladi. Ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy omillar, masalan,
ishsizlik va kambag‘allik ham o‘smirlar ruhiyatiga salbiy ta’sir qilishi mumkin.
O‘smirlar uchun ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlash, ya’ni oila, do‘stlar va jamoatchilik
tomonidan ko‘rsatiladigan yordam juda muhim. Iqlim o‘zgarishi va demografik o‘zgarishlar
natijasida ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlash tizimlari zaiflashishi mumkin, bu esa o‘smirlarning
yolg‘izlik hissini kuchaytiradi va suitsidal xulq xavfini oshiradi.
ADABIYOTLAR TAHLILI VA METODLAR.
Smitning ta’kidlashicha, iqlim o‘zgarishi o‘smirlarda stress, depressiya va xavotirni
kuchaytirishi mumkin. Tabiiy ofatlar va iqlimga bog‘liq o‘zgarishlar psixologik bosim manbai
bo‘lishi mumkin.
Urbanizatsiya va migratsiya kabi demografik o‘zgarishlar ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy omillar
orqali o‘smirlar psixologiyasiga ta’sir qiladi. Yangi muhitga moslashishdagi qiyinchiliklar
ruhiy salomatlikka salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatishi mumkin (Johnson, 2019).
Ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlash tizimi o‘smirlar uchun muhim ahamiyatga ega. Oila va
do‘stlar tomonidan ko‘rsatiladigan yordam suitsidal xulqni kamaytirishda yordam beradi
(Brown, 2022).
84

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Shaxsiy xislatlar, jumladan, emotsional barqarorlik va stressga chidamlilik suitsidal
xulqqa ta’sir qilishi mumkin. Bunday omillar ruhiy salomatlikni yaxshilashda muhimdir (Lee
& Miller, 2021).
Migratsiya jarayonida yangi muhitga moslashishdagi qiyinchiliklar va ijtimoiy qo‘llabquvvatlashning yetishmasligi o‘smirlarning ruhiy salomatligiga salbiy ta’sir qilishi mumkin
(Davis, 2023).
Jamiyatdagi ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy o‘zgarishlar va ularning o‘smirlar ruhiyatiga ta’siri
muhokama qilinadi. Ayniqsa, ta’lim tizimidagi o‘zgarishlar va ishsizlik kabi omillar stress
manbai bo‘lishi mumkin. Madaniy qadriyatlar va an’analarning o‘smirlar ruhiy salomatligiga
ta’siri muhim hisoblanadi. O‘zbek madaniyatidagi qadriyatlar va ijtimoiy normalar ruhiy
salomatlikni qo‘llab-quvvatlashda muhim rol o‘ynaydi (Ismoilova G.2019)
Ta’lim jarayonidagi tarbiya usullari va ularning o‘smirlar psixologiyasiga ta’siri
o‘rganiladi. Ijobiy tarbiya usullari va ta’lim muhiti o‘smirlarning ruhiy salomatligiga ijobiy
ta’sir ko‘rsatadi (Nurmatov, 2020).
Suicidal xulq-atvor biologik, psixologik va ijtimoiy omillar o‘zaro ta'sirida shakllanadi.
Genetik moyillik, ruhiy kasalliklar, stress va ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlashning yetishmasligi
muhim rol o‘ynaydi.
O‘smirlik davri inson hayotida muhim o‘tish davri bo‘lib, bu davrda shaxsiy
identifikatsiya va o‘zini anglash jarayonlari yuz beradi. Ruhiy salomatlikning buzilishi ushbu
jarayonlarga salbiy ta'sir ko‘rsatishi mumkin. Oila, do‘stlar va jamiyatning qo‘llab-quvvatlashi
o‘smirlarning ruhiy salomatligi uchun juda muhim. Ijtimoiy izolyatsiya va zo‘ravonlik kabi
omillar suicidal xulq-atvorga olib kelishi mumkin.
Depressiya, xavotir va boshqa ruhiy kasalliklar suicidal xulq-atvor xavfini oshiradi.
O‘smirlar ko‘pincha o‘z his-tuyg‘ularini ifoda etishda qiyinchiliklarga duch kelishi mumkin.
Ta'lim muhitidagi stress va bosim ham suicidal xulq-atvorga ta'sir qilishi mumkin. Maktabda
qo‘llab-quvvatlovchi muhit yaratish muhimdir.
METODIKA. Suitsidal xulq-atvorni o‘rganish murakkab va ko‘p omilli jarayon bo‘lib,
bu sohadagi tadqiqotlar turli nazariy asoslarga tayanadi. Suitsidal xulq-atvor o‘z ichiga o‘ziga
zarar yetkazishga urinish, suitsid fikrlari va rejalarini oladi. Bu holat ko‘pincha depressiya,
xavotir va boshqa psixopatologik holatlar bilan bog‘liq bo‘lishi mumkin. Suitsidning sabablari
biologik, psixologik va ijtimoiy omillardan iborat. Biologik omillar genetik ta’sirlar va
neyrotransmitterlar muvozanatining buzilishi bilan bog‘liq. Psixologik omillar shaxsiy
muammolar, stress va o‘zini yolg‘iz his qilishni o‘z ichiga oladi. Ijtimoiy omillar esa oilaviy
muammolar va ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlashning yetishmasligi bilan bog‘liq.
Suitsidal xulq-atvorni o‘rganishda kvantitativ va kualitativ usullar qo‘llaniladi.
Kvantitativ usullar so‘rovnomalar va testlar orqali ma’lumot yig‘ishni o‘z ichiga oladi, natijalar
statistik tahlillar orqali baholanadi. Kualitativ usullar esa intervyu va fokus guruhlar orqali
chuqurroq tushuncha hosil qilishga yo‘naltirilgan.
85

Ko‘ndalang tadqiqotlar aholida suitsidal xulq-atvor tarqalishini bir vaqtning o‘zida
o‘rganishga mo‘ljallangan. Longitudinal tadqiqotlar esa suitsidal xulq-atvorning vaqt
davomidagi o‘zgarishini kuzatishni o‘z ichiga oladi. Tadqiqot etikasi ishonchlilik va
maxfiylikni ta’minlashni talab qiladi. Ishtirokchilarning shaxsiy ma’lumotlari maxfiy saqlanishi
va ularning roziligi olinishi kerak. Shuningdek, ishtirokchilarga qo‘llab-quvvatlash va yordam
ko‘rsatish imkoniyatlari taqdim etilishi zarur.
Statistik tahlillar, jumladan, korelyatsiya va regressiya tahlillari, shuningdek, klaster
tahlillari qo‘llaniladi. Kualitativ tahlillar esa tematika va kontent tahlillarni o‘z ichiga oladi.
Ushbu nazariy asoslar suitsidal xulq-atvorni chuqurroq tushunish va uning oldini olish bo‘yicha
samarali strategiyalar ishlab chiqishga yordam beradi.

Gender va demografik omillar
Gender omillari: Qizlar orasida suitsidal xulq-atvor ko‘proq kuzatilgan. Bu genderga
xos omillarni chuqurroq o‘rganish zarurligini ko‘rsatadi.
Demografik omillar: Ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy holat suitsidal xulq-atvorga ta’sir qilishi
mumkin. Bu ijtimoiy yordam dasturlarini rivojlantirish zarurligini anglatadi.
Suitsidal xavfni baholash. Suitsidal xavfni baholash uchun ishlab chiqilgan model xavf
guruhlarini aniqlash va ularga yo‘naltirilgan yordam ko‘rsatish imkonini beradi. Bu profilaktika
choralarini samarali amalga oshirishga yordam beradi.
Profilaktika strategiyalari
Dasturlar va treninglar, bu o‘smirlar uchun maxsus profilaktika dasturlari va treninglar
tavsiya etilgan. Bu ularning ruhiy salomatligini yaxshilash va suitsidal xulq-atvorni oldini
olishga qaratilgan.
NATIJALAR VA MUHOKAMA.
Ta’lim va ma’rifat ishlarini kuchaytirish orqali o‘smirlarni ruhiy salomatlik masalalari
bo‘yicha xabardor qilish muhimdir. Maktablarda ruhiy salomatlik bo‘yicha maxsus dasturlar va
treninglar tashkil etilishi kerak. Bu dasturlar o‘smirlarni o‘z his-tuyg‘ularini tushunishga,
stressni boshqarishga va muammolarni hal qilish ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishga o‘rgatadi.
Iqlim o‘zgarishi ham o‘smirlarning ruhiy salomatligiga ta’sir ko‘rsatishi mumkin.
Shuning uchun, iqlim o‘zgarishiga moslashish strategiyalarini ishlab chiqish va amalga oshirish
muhimdir. Bu strategiyalar o‘smirlarni iqlim o‘zgarishidan kelib chiqadigan stress va xavotirni
boshqarishga yordam berishi mumkin. Shuningdek, ekologik ta’lim orqali ularni atrof-muhitni
asrash va iqlim o‘zgarishiga qarshi kurashishda faol ishtirok etishga undash mumkin.
Yuqorida keltirilgan chora-tadbirlar o‘smirlar orasida suitsidal xulq-atvorni
kamaytirishga va ularning ruhiy salomatligini yaxshilashga qaratilgan. Ushbu chora-tadbirlarni
amalga oshirishda davlat idoralari, ta’lim muassasalari, sog‘liqni saqlash tashkilotlari va jamoat
birlashmalari birgalikda ishlashi zarur. Faqatgina kompleks yondashuv orqali o‘smirlarning
hayot sifatini yaxshilash va suitsidal xulq-atvorning oldini olish mumkin. Har bir o‘smirning
individual ehtiyojlarini inobatga olish va ularga mos yondashuvni tanlash ham juda muhimdir.
Iqlim o‘zgarishi va demografik o‘zgarishlar o‘smirlar suitsidal xulqiga jiddiy ta’sir
ko‘rsatadi. Bu muammolarni hal qilish uchun kompleks yondashuv talab etiladi. Iqlim
o‘zgarishiga qarshi kurashish, ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlash tizimlarini mustahkamlash va
o‘smirlarga psixologik yordam ko‘rsatish orqali suitsidal xulqning oldini olish mumkin.

style is conceptualized as a stable, individual pattern of processing information, grounded in the
brain’s functional architecture, including hemispheric asymmetry, prefrontal cortex activity,
and mechanisms of neuroplasticity. The paper analyzes leading theoretical models and
empirical findings related to major cognitive style dichotomies such as field dependenceindependence, impulsivity-reflectivity, and analyticity-holism. The study highlights how these
styles influence students’ learning strategies, information retention, and motivational
engagement. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of neuropedagogical strategies
to accommodate cognitive diversity, foster cognitive flexibility, and design adaptive and
cognitively supportive learning environments. The paper offers recommendations for cognitive
profiling, pedagogical adaptation, and instructional planning to enhance educational efficiency,
inclusivity, and personalization.
Keywords: cognitive styles, neuropsychology, learning, individualization, cognitive

ВВЕДЕНИЕ
Современное образование сталкивается с необходимостью учитывать
индивидуальные особенности обучающихся, чтобы создать максимально эффективную
и гуманную учебную среду. Одним из ключевых факторов индивидуализации учебной
деятельности являются когнитивные стили — устойчивые способы восприятия,
переработки и использования информации в познавательной деятельности [1]. Интерес к
90

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

когнитивным стилям обусловлен их тесной связью с нейропсихологической
организацией мозга и различиями в функционировании лобных, теменных и височных
долей [2].
Понимание нейропсихологических основ когнитивных стилей позволяет
построить более гибкую и эффективную образовательную модель, ориентированную на
потенциал каждого студента. Это не только способствует повышению качества
обучения, но и формирует основы для развития саморегуляции, критического мышления
и метакогнитивной компетентности – ключевых навыков XXI века.
Актуальность темы определяется необходимостью разработки педагогических
стратегий, способствующих формированию когнитивно комфортной среды с учетом
когнитивной дифференциации учащихся. Это особенно важно в условиях цифровизации
образования, где уровень сенсорной нагрузки и когнитивных требований возрастает [3].
Целью данной работы является обоснование когнитивных стилей как
нейропсихологической основы индивидуализации учебного процесса и разработка
рекомендаций по их использованию в образовательной практике.
Задачами данного исследования выступают:
1. Проанализировать теоретико-методологические подходы к изучению
когнитивных стилей.
2. Выявить нейропсихологические предпосылки когнитивной дифференциации.
3. Систематизировать типологию когнитивных стилей в контексте студенческой
аудитории.
4. Определить влияние когнитивных стилей на академическую успеваемость и
стратегии обучения.
5. Разработать практические рекомендации по адаптации учебного процесса с
учетом когнитивных стилей студентов.
Новизна исследования заключается в синтезе нейропсихологических и
педагогических подходов к изучению когнитивных стилей, а также в акценте на их роли
как механизма индивидуализации учебной деятельности. Предлагаемый подход выходит
за рамки традиционных педагогических моделей и ориентирован на создание условий
для развития когнитивной гибкости и повышения обучаемости через работу с
нейропсихологическим профилем обучающихся.
Практическая значимость заключается в возможности применения полученных
результатов для проектирования адаптивных образовательных программ, повышения
эффективности педагогического воздействия, оптимизации учебной нагрузки, а также
профилактики учебных трудностей, связанных с несоответствием педагогических
стратегий когнитивному профилю студентов.
МЕТОДЫ
Методологическая база настоящего исследования опирается на комплексный
междисциплинарный подход, объединяющий принципы когнитивной психологии,
91

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

нейропсихологии, педагогики и дидактики. Основное внимание уделено анализу
научной литературы, в том числе классических работ и современных эмпирических
исследований, посвящённых изучению когнитивных стилей и их влиянию на учебную
деятельность.
В частности, были проанализированы теоретические концепции Л.С. Выготского,
в которых подчеркивается роль социально-культурной среды и речевой активности в
развитии высших психических функций [4]. Исследования А.Р. Лурии легли в основу
анализа нейропсихологических основ индивидуальных различий, включая организацию
познавательных процессов и межполушарную асимметрию [5]. Концепции Г. Виткина о
«зависимости-независимости от поля» позволили интерпретировать особенности
пространственной ориентации и обработки информации у обучающихся [6]. Труды
Гарднера о множественном интеллекте и индивидуальных познавательных стратегиях
также послужили основой при разработке аналитического инструментария [7].
Для обработки теоретических и эмпирических источников использовались
следующие методы:
 Контент-анализ – позволил систематизировать и классифицировать основные
подходы к определению и классификации когнитивных стилей, а также выявить
наиболее значимые переменные, влияющие на образовательную результативность.
 Сравнительно-сопоставительный анализ – применялся для выявления различий и
сходств между существующими типологиями когнитивных стилей (например,
дихотомии
«аналитичность-холизм»,
«импульсивность-рефлективность»,
«вербальность-визуальность» и др.).
 Системный подход – использовался для построения модели влияния когнитивных
стилей на структуру и динамику учебной деятельности, а также на результаты учебной
деятельности в условиях вариативной образовательной среды. Этот подход позволил
рассматривать когнитивные стили не как изолированные характеристики, а как элементы
сложной нейропсихологической системы, включающей мотивацию, память, внимание,
эмоциональную регуляцию и другие когнитивные параметры.
Таким образом, исследование строилось на прочной теоретико-методологической
основе и включало всесторонний анализ научных источников с целью обоснования
значимости когнитивных стилей как фактора индивидуализации учебной деятельности.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ
Анализ литературы позволил выделить ключевые дихотомии когнитивных стилей:
1. Зависимость-независимость от поля
Исследования Г. Виткина показали, что зависимые от поля обучающиеся
ориентированы на внешние ориентиры и подвержены влиянию контекста, тогда как
независимые склонны к внутренней когнитивной референтности [8]. Это влияет на
учебные стратегии: первые эффективнее в коллективной деятельности, вторые – в
индивидуальной аналитической работе.
92

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

2. Импульсивность-рефлективность
Импульсивные учащиеся склонны к быстрому, но менее точному принятию
решений, в то время как рефлективные демонстрируют замедленное, но более точное
мышление [9]. Это особенно критично при проектировании заданий с ограниченным
временем выполнения.
3. Аналитичность-холизм
Аналитики фокусируются на деталях и структуре материала, в то время как
холисты – на общем контексте и связях между элементами [10]. Учет этих различий
помогает преподавателю гибко выстраивать образовательный контент и способы его
подачи.
Нейропсихологические данные указывают на связь когнитивных стилей с
особенностями межполушарной асимметрии, а также доминированием различных
отделов мозга. Например, рефлективный стиль может быть ассоциирован с большей
активностью префронтальной коры, ответственной за самоконтроль и планирование [11].
Анализ литературы и сопоставление различных теоретических моделей позволили
выявить ключевые дихотомии когнитивных стилей, имеющих наибольшее значение в
образовательной практике. Ниже представлены основные стили, их характеристика,
нейропсихологическая основа и педагогические рекомендации.

Данная таблица представляет собой обобщение шести ключевых когнитивных
стилей, наиболее часто встречающихся в образовательной среде, с акцентом на их
нейропсихологическую природу и педагогические следствия. Анализ представленных
данных позволяет выделить несколько критически важных направлений в построении
вариативной образовательной среды.
Во-первых, наблюдается четкая связь между стилями и доминированием
различных функциональных систем головного мозга. Например, зависимость от поля,
как правило, ассоциируется с преобладанием правополушарных механизмов,
ответственных за глобальное восприятие, эмоциональную и контекстуальную обработку
информации. Это делает таких студентов более чувствительными к окружающим
сигналам, менее склонными к абстрагированию и самостоятельному анализу. В
контексте обучения это требует организации визуально насыщенной среды, четкой
пошаговой подачи материала и использования методов совместного обучения.
Независимость от поля, напротив, опирается на активность левого полушария, что
проявляется в способности учащегося отделять суть от контекста, анализировать
информацию независимо от фоновых раздражителей. Такие студенты предпочитают
индивидуальные формы работы, задания с высокой степенью абстракции и
интеллектуальной нагрузки. Их когнитивный стиль идеально подходит для освоения
научных дисциплин и проектной деятельности.
Во-вторых, стиль «импульсивность» указывает на недостаточную регуляцию
поведения, связанную с низкой активностью префронтальной коры – области мозга,
отвечающей за планирование, торможение импульсов и контроль. В учебной среде это
проявляется в поспешных ошибках, трудностях с концентрацией внимания и плохой
организованности. Поэтому образовательные стратегии для таких учеников должны
включать поэтапные инструкции, постоянную обратную связь и тренировку навыков
саморегуляции.
Рефлективные учащиеся, напротив, демонстрируют высокий уровень
самоконтроля, связанный с активностью дорсолатеральной префронтальной зоны. Это
обеспечивает более точные, обоснованные решения, но часто замедляет темп работы.
Такие учащиеся нуждаются в расширении временных рамок выполнения заданий, а
также в заданиях, требующих анализа, размышлений и построения логических цепочек.
Когнитивные стили аналитичности и холизма отражают различия в обработке
информации: одни (аналитики) стремятся к детализации, построению схем и структур,
94

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

другие (холисты) – к пониманию общих смыслов, видению целостной картины. С точки
зрения нейропсихологии, аналитичность коррелирует с левополушарной активностью, а
холизм требует сбалансированной работы обоих полушарий, что особенно важно при
интегративных видах деятельности. Это подсказывает преподавателю необходимость
гибкой подачи материала – сочетания схем и текстов, анализа и синтеза, частного и
общего.
Таким образом, таблица наглядно демонстрирует, что учет нейропсихологических
основ когнитивных стилей позволяет проектировать учебный процесс с опорой на
сильные стороны обучающихся. Это создает условия для развития познавательного
потенциала каждого студента, способствует формированию устойчивой мотивации к
обучению, а также минимизирует риски перегрузки или фрустрации, обусловленные
несоответствием методов обучения когнитивному профилю ученика.
Для выявления доминирующих когнитивных предпочтений среди студентов была
проведена диагностика с использованием валидированных психодиагностических
методик. Результаты представлены в форме процентного соотношения испытуемых,
демонстрирующих выраженность определённых когнитивных стилей (см. диагр.1).
Диаграмма 1. Распределение когнитивных стилей среди студентов

Диаграмма 1 демонстрирует высокий уровень когнитивного разнообразия в
выборке студентов. Наибольшее количество участников проявили аналитический стиль
мышления (38%), что свидетельствует о склонности к логической, структурированной
обработке информации. Следом по численности идут холисты (35%), предпочитающие
целостный подход и ориентированные на общий контекст материала.
Примечательно, что независимость от поля (32%) встречается чаще, чем
зависимость (28%), что говорит о развитых навыках абстрагирования у большинства
студентов. Также наблюдается преобладание рефлективных учащихся (26%) над
95

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

импульсивными (21%), что может свидетельствовать о сформированности
саморегуляции и аналитического подхода при выполнении учебных заданий.
Полученные данные подтверждают необходимость использования гибких
образовательных стратегий, позволяющих учитывать весь спектр когнитивных
предпочтений – от структурированной подачи материала до проектных и контекстно
ориентированных форм обучения.
Результаты исследования подтверждают следующее:
 Когнитивные стили определяют предпочитаемые стратегии обучения.
 Нейропсихологическая основа стилей позволяет объяснить индивидуальные
различия в учебной активности.
 Педагогическая адаптация под стили учащихся приводит к повышению
мотивации, вовлеченности и учебных достижений.
 Необходима диагностика стилей на ранних этапах образовательного пути.
ОБСУЖДЕНИЕ
Полученные в ходе исследования результаты с убедительностью подтверждают:
учет когнитивного профиля обучающегося – это не просто дополнительная опция, а
необходимое условие проектирования эффективной образовательной среды. Каждый
обучающийся обладает уникальной конфигурацией когнитивных характеристик,
которые определяют не только его предпочтения в способах получения и переработки
информации, но и глубину, темп, устойчивость и успешность учебной деятельности.
В условиях традиционного унифицированного обучения, когда все студенты
получают одинаковые задания, в одинаковом темпе и с одинаковым уровнем абстракции,
значительная часть обучающихся оказывается в когнитивно некомфортной среде, что
снижает не только эффективность, но и мотивацию к обучению. Это особенно актуально
в свете стремительно развивающихся технологий, перехода к цифровым форматам и
необходимости быстрой адаптации учащихся к новым условиям. В этом контексте
критически важным становится внедрение нейропедагогических подходов, которые
основываются на научных знаниях о работе мозга, его пластичности и индивидуальных
траекториях развития познавательных функций [12].
Одним из ключевых понятий в рамках нейропедагогики является
нейропластичность – способность мозга изменяться в ответ на опыт, обучение и
тренировку. Именно она лежит в основе формирования когнитивной гибкости –
способности адаптироваться к новым условиям, переходить от одного стиля мышления
к другому в зависимости от требований учебной задачи. Развитие этой гибкости
возможно за счет правильно организованного образовательного процесса, где
сочетаются структурированные задания (например, тесты, алгоритмы, пошаговые
инструкции) и открытые форматы (дискуссии, исследовательские проекты, кейс-стади).
Такой сбалансированный подход не только охватывает потребности студентов с
96

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

различными когнитивными стилями, но и позволяет им тренировать альтернативные
стратегии мышления, тем самым расширяя их познавательные ресурсы.
Кроме того, ключевым условием успешной реализации индивидуализированного
подхода является повышение педагогической компетентности в области когнитивной
диагностики. На сегодняшний день большинство преподавателей не обладают
инструментарием для точной оценки когнитивных характеристик студентов, а также не
знают, как корректно интерпретировать полученные данные. В этой связи важно
включать в педагогическое образование модули по нейропсихологии, когнитивной
психологии и адаптивной дидактике, а также разрабатывать инструменты самооценки и
наблюдательной диагностики, позволяющие преподавателю быстро ориентироваться в
потребностях студентов.
Особого внимания заслуживает также необходимость формирования
метакогнитивной компетентности у самих студентов – осознанного понимания своих
сильных и слабых сторон, способов работы с информацией, стратегий решения задач.
Это не только усиливает способность к саморегуляции, но и способствует построению
более осознанной, целенаправленной траектории обучения. Таким образом, обсуждение
представленных результатов позволяет сформулировать несколько принципиальных
выводов:

Разнообразие когнитивных стилей – это ресурс, а не препятствие, при
условии его педагогического учета.

Гибкая образовательная среда – это пространство, адаптированное под
когнитивные особенности всех обучающихся.


для проектирования таких сред.

Повышение профессиональной подготовки преподавателей в области
когнитивной диагностики и адаптации учебных материалов – необходимое
условие успешной образовательной трансформации.

Интеграция метакогнитивного компонента в образовательный процесс
повышает осознанность и автономность обучающихся.
Реализация этих положений может существенно повысить эффективность,
инклюзивность и гуманизацию современного образования, сделав его по-настоящему

РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ
Анализ обширного круга научных источников, охватывающих как классические
теоретические положения, так и современные эмпирические данные, позволил выделить
и обобщить ряд ключевых когнитивных дихотомий, оказывающих существенное
влияние на поведение обучающихся в учебном процессе. Эти дихотомии выступают не
только в качестве классификационных категорий, но и как инструменты
нейропсихологического объяснения индивидуальных различий в учебной деятельности.

Выделенные когнитивные стили имеют различную нейропсихологическую
природу, связанную с доминированием определённых функциональных систем мозга,
включая лобные, теменные и височные области, отвечающие за когнитивный контроль,
обработку сенсорной информации и интеграцию межполушарной активности. Эти
особенности находят прямое отражение в том, каким образом обучающийся
воспринимает, перерабатывает и воспроизводит учебный материал, как он планирует
действия, регулирует эмоции, распределяет внимание и принимает решения.
Анализ ключевых дихотомий когнитивных стилей:
Зависимость — независимость от поля
Эта дихотомия отражает различия в способности учащихся выделять
существенные элементы из сложной среды. Зависимые от поля ориентируются на
внешние стимулы и с трудом абстрагируются от фона, что делает их уязвимыми к
перегрузке при большом количестве информации. Независимые от поля, напротив,
демонстрируют устойчивость к отвлекающим факторам и способны к самоконтролю и
аналитической деятельности. На нейропсихологическом уровне это связано с
различиями в интеграции зрительно-пространственных и лобных систем, а также
уровнем межполушарной координации [4][6].
Импульсивность — рефлективность
Эта дихотомия связана с особенностями когнитивного темпа и способами
принятия решений. Импульсивные студенты склонны к быстрой реакции и часто
совершают ошибки из-за недостатка обдуманности. Их нейропсихологическая картина
характеризуется недостаточной активностью префронтальной коры, ответственной за
торможение и планирование. Рефлективные учащиеся, напротив, демонстрируют
высокую избирательность и точность, но могут сталкиваться с трудностями в ситуациях,
требующих быстроты. Такие различия напрямую влияют на выбор дидактических
форматов: рефлективным необходимо больше времени на обдумывание, импульсивным
– четкие рамки и поэтапное выполнение заданий [7][9].
Аналитичность — холизм
Представители аналитического стиля склонны к детальному анализу информации,
построению логических структур, их мышление часто линеарно и иерархично. Это
связано с левополушарной специализацией, направленной на последовательную
обработку информации. Холисты, напротив, воспринимают информацию целостно,
фокусируются на связях и контексте, полагаясь на межполушарную интеграцию и
правополушарную активность. Это обусловливает предпочтения в типах заданий:
аналитики лучше справляются с решением задач по алгоритму, холисты – с открытыми,
исследовательскими и проектными формами деятельности [5][8].
Кроме того, полученные данные открывают перспективы для внедрения
диагностических инструментов на этапе поступления или первых семестров обучения, с

KIRISH. Bugungi kunda yurtimizda bolalar va o‘smirlar sportini rivojlantirish,
barkamol avlodni tarbiyalashning eng muhim sharti sifatida amalga oshirilayotgan choradir,
shuningdek hech kimga sir emaski bugun sport bilan shug’ullanayotgan bolalar va o‘smirlar
ertaga O‘zbekistonning bayrog’ini xalqaro maydonlarda turli sport turlari bo‘yicha baland

ko‘taruvchi kelajak avlod hamdir. Shundan kelib chiqqan holda, bo‘lajak sportchilarni munosib
tayyorlash har doimgidan ham dolzarblikni kasb etadi.
Volleybol bugungi kunda ommaviyligi va mashxurligi bo‘yicha dunyoda 5-o‘rinda
turuvchi sport turidir hamda u bilan butun dunyoda 210 milliondan ortiq insonlar shug’ullanadi.
Dunyoda 60 mingdan ortiq volleybol jamoalari mavjudligi hamda 200 dan ortiq davlatlarda
volleybol rasman tan olingan sport turi sanalishi [1] yurtimizda esa 49 mindan ortiq volleybol
bilan shug’ullanadigan sportchilar mavjudligi [2] o‘z navbatida mazkur sport turning rivojlanish
istiqboli va imkoniyatlari ayniqsa yuqoriligidan dalolat beradi. Yoshlar soni salmoqli bo‘lgan
mamlakat sifatida jamoaviy sport bo‘lgan volleybol eng ommabop sportga aylanishi ehtimoli
yuqori. Bunday sharoitda volleybolchilarni musobaqalarga tayyorlash jarayoniga jiddiy e’tibor
berish ham davr talabidir.
Yuqoridagilardan kelib chiqqan holda volleybol sport turini rivojlantirish, jumladan
volleybolchilarni musobaqalarga tayyorlash ilmiy va amaliy jihatdan muammoga aylanib
bormoqda, zero mazkur masalaga oid aniq chora-tadbirlar ko‘rilmasa, ilmiy izlanishlar olib
borilmasa murosasiz raqobat muhitida katta natijalarga umid qilib bo‘lmaydi. Shunga asosan,
biz intellekt darajasi volleybolchilarning musobaqalardagi muvaffaqiyatli ishtiroki omili
sifatida yuzaga chiqishi mumkinligini ko‘rib chiqishga qaratilgan kichik tadqiqot o‘tkazishga
harakat qilamiz va mazkur masalani atroflicha va albatta ilmiy ko‘rib chiqish zaruratini inobatga
olamiz. Tadqiqotimizning asosiy obyekti sifatida volleybol bo‘yicha 18 yoshgacha bo‘lgan
o‘g’il bolalar bo‘yicha milliy terma jamoa a’zolari bo‘lgan 17 nafar o‘smir volleybolchilar
tanlab olindi.
Bizning fikrimizcha sportchining boshqa bilim-ko‘nikmalari qatorida uning intellektual
salohiyati va darajasi muayyan ma’noda sport natijalariga ta’sir qiluvchi omil bo‘ladi. O‘z
navbatida sportchilarning tajribasi, xalqaro maydondagi o‘yinlari tarixi, sabru-matonati,
chidamliligi, yaxshi koordinatsiya, konsentratsiya, jamoaviylik hamda jamoada ishlay olishi,
muvozanatlashgan emotsional boshqaruv, adekvat munosabatlar, samarali jismoniy, taktik va
texnik tayyorgarlik, tomonlardan bo‘ladigan moddiy va ma’naviy stimullar kabi omillar sport
natijalarini asosiy omillari sifatida volleybol sportida saqlanib qolishini also inkor etmaymiz.
Bundan tashqari bo‘y, qulochlar kengligi, yuqoriroq sakray olish qobiliyati, plastika kabi
boshqa biometrik parametrlar ham volleybolda muvaffaqiyatli natijalar omili sanaladi.
ADABIYOTLAR TAHLILI VA METODLAR. O‘zbekiston Respublikasi
Prezidentining 2024-yil 19-iyuldagi “Voleybol sport turlarini yanada rivojlantirish choratadbirlari to‘g‘risida” PQ-274-son hamda 2024-yil 4-dekabrdagi “Jamoaviy sport turlarini
rivojlantirish va iqtidorli yoshlarni saralab olish tizimini takomillashtirish chora-tadbirlari
to‘g‘risida” PQ-421-son qarorlari qabul qilinishi o‘zbek volleybolining yangi tarixi va
natijalarining asosi bo‘lib xizmat qilishi shubhasiz. Ikkinchidan esa, mazkur qarorlar
volleybolchilarni avvalgidan ham mukammal va professional tayyorgarligini ta’minlashni
taqozo etmoqda.

Bilamizki zamonaviy professional sportda nafaqat taktik, texnik, jismoniy tayyorgarlik,
balki sog’lomlashtirish va psixologik tayyorgarlik bilan oliy darajadagi natijalarga erishiladi.
Inchunun, Davlatimiz rahbari tomonidan ham bir qator aniq ko‘rsatmalar bor [3, 4]. O‘zbekiston
Respublikasining 2015-yil 4-sentyabrdagi “Jismoniy tarbiya va sport to‘g‘risida”gi O‘zbekiston
Respublikasi Qonuniga o‘zgartish va qo‘shimchalar kiritish haqida” O‘RQ-394-son Qonunida
[5] bir tomondan sport orqali intellektual salohiyatni kamol topdirish, ikkinchi tomondan
havaskor va professional sportda intekkeltual salohiyat inobatga olinishi nazarda tutiladi, bu esa
jismoniy tarbiya va sportda intellectual xususiyatlar shaxsga mazkur faoliyatda determinant
ekanligiga ishora.
Shuningdek, sportchi kadrlarni tayyorlash tizimining normativ-huquqiy bazasi
mavjudligiga alohida e’tibor qaratishimiz kerakki, zero bu sportchilarni har tomonlama
mukammal tayyorlab borilishining asosidir. Jumladan O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Vazirlar
Mahkamasining 2019-yil 12-iyuldagi “O‘quvchilarni psixologik-pedagogik qo‘llab-quvvatlash
ishlarini yanada takomillashtirish to‘g‘risida” 577-son qaroriga ko‘ra umumta’lim muassasalari
psixologlari sport musobaqalarini kuzatishi, tahlil qilishi, o‘quvchilarning shaxsiy hujjatlari
bilan tanishishi, zarur taklif va maslahatlar berishi belgilab berilgan. Demak, maktab
darajasidan boshlab sportchi o‘quvchilarning psixologik sohasiga e’tibor qaratilishi nazarda
tutilgan.
Bundan tashqari, O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Vazirlar Mahkamasining 2022-yil 30dekabrdagi “Olimpiya va paralimpiya sport turlariga tayyorlash markazlari faoliyatini tashkil
etish chora-tadbirlari to‘g‘risida” 731-son qaroriga ko‘ra olimpiya va paralimpiya sport turlariga
tayyorlash markazlari o‘quvchilarining psixologik holati, psixologik tayyorgarligini kuzatib,
yaxshilab borishga alohida e’tibor qaratilganligi, jumladan psixolog va sport psixolog shtatlarini
joriy etilgan holda har bir sportchiga kerakli psixologik xizmat ko‘rsatilishi, sifatli psixologik
xizmatni ta’minlash maqsadida sport psixologlari va psixologlarni rag’batlantirish tizimi joriy
etilganligi diqqatga sazovordir. Jumladan mazkur qarorda psixologik tayyorgarlik masalasiga
alohida ta’riq ham berilgan bo‘lib u o‘quvchilarning sport tayyorgarligi o‘quv-mashq
mashg‘ulotlarini o‘zlashtirishda va sport musobaqalariga tayyorgarlik ko‘rish hamda ularda
ishtirok etish jarayonlariga psixo-fiziologik yondashuvlar asosida tashxislar va psixologik testsinovlarini o‘tkazish, ularni psixologik jihatdan tayyorlash orqali amalga oshiriladi [6] tarzida
hujjatda keltiriladi.
Ko‘rib chiqqanlarimiz, masalaning normativ-huquqiy, davlat darajasiga ko‘tarilgan
ekanligini ko‘rsatadi.
Ilmiy manbalarda intellekt darajasi sportchilarning musobaqalardagi muvaffaqiyatli
ishtiroki omili sifatida qanchalik o‘rganilganligiga e’tibor qaratadigan bo‘lsak, sport
psixologiyasida sportchilarning intellektual qobiliyatlarini o‘rganish muhim yo‘nalishlardan
biri sifatida namoyon bo‘lishini alohida ko‘rsatib o‘tishimiz mumkin. Intellektual qobiliyatlar
sportchilar uchun muhim bo‘lgan strategik fikrlash, qaror qabul qilish va stressni boshqarish
102

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

kabi ko‘nikmalarni rivojlantiradi. Kognitiv funksiyalar, xususan, ijro etuvchi, nazorat, diqqat va
qaror qabul qilish qobiliyatlari sport natijalarida muhim ahamiyatga ega.
Tadqiqotlarga ko‘ra, yuqori IQ ko‘rsatkichlari sportchilarning strategik rejalashtirish va
samarali qaror qabul qilish qobiliyatlarini oshiradi. Masalan, Ravenning progressiv matritsalari
bo‘yicha yuqori natijaga ega bo‘lgan sportchilar murakkab vaziyatlarda samaraliroq harakat
qilishi ishbotlangan. Jumladan statistik ma'lumotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, Raven testida 110+ ball
to‘plagan voleybolchilar jamoaviy o‘yinlarda 75% ko‘proq muvaffaqiyatga erishgan va
o‘rganilgan 120 voleybolchilar orasida IQ va muvaffaqiyat ko‘rsatkichlari o‘rtasidagi
korrelyatsiya koeffitsienti r = 0.65, bu esa sezilarli bog'liqlikni ko‘rsatadi (p < 0.01). [7] Demak,
sportchilarni saralashda ularning IQ darajasi yuqori bo’lishiga ahamiyat berish kerak, zero bu
bo’lajak professional sportchining natijalarini yuqoriroq bo’lishini kafolatlaydi.
Shunindek, yana bir o‘tkazilgan tajriba [8] natijalariga ko‘ra, 15 ta professional
voleybolchi orasida diqqatni jamlash mashqlari o‘yin sifatiga sezilarli ta'sir ko‘rsatganni
aniqlangan. Mashg’ulotlardan oldin oldin o‘rtacha o‘yin samaradorligi 70% bo‘lgan bo‘lsa,
diqqatni yaxshilovchi mashqlar treninglaridan so‘ng bu ko‘rsatkich 85% ga oshgan. Diqqatni
yaxshilovchi mashqlar, jumladan neyrogimnastikalardan sportchilar muntazam foydalanishi,
musobaqa oldi va trenerovka oldi qizdiruvchi mashqlari orasida foydalanishi maqsadga
muvofiq.
IQ yuqori bo‘lgan voleybolchilar o‘yin vaqtida tezkor va samarali qaror qabul qilishadi,
bu esa ularning natijalariga ijobiy ta’sir ko‘rsatishi isbotlangan, jumladan IQ ko‘rsatkichi yuqori
bo‘lgan sportchilar qarshi hujumlarni amalga oshirish va himoyada 65% muvaffaqiyatliroq
bo‘lgan. [9] Demak, nafaqat sport ijrosi balki xatolarni, jamoa muvaffaqiyatsizligini oldini
olishda ham IQ yuqori bo’lishi, sport natijalarining stabilligini ham ta’minlashi mumkin,
Chunki, professional sportchini ham kuchli pressing qila olishi hamki kuchli bosimni ko’tara
olishi uni haqiqiy professionalga aylantiradi.
Tahlillar shuni ko‘rsatdiki, yana bir muhim intellekt shakli Emotsional intellekt - EI
darajasi past bo‘lgan sportchilar o‘yin davomida stressga duch kelib, noto‘g'ri qarorlar qabul
qilishadi. Shu bilan birga, EI darajasini oshirishga yo‘naltirilgan maxsus mashg'ulotlardan
so‘ng, bunday sportchilarning o‘yin samaradorligi 40% dan 70% gacha ko‘tarilgan. EI
darajasi yuqori bo‘lgan voleybolchilar o‘rtasida musobaqalarda muvaffaqiyat ko‘rsatkichi 80%
ga yaqin bo‘lgan. Jamoaviy muvaffaqiyat va EI o‘rtasidagi korrelyatsiya koeffitsienti r = 0.72,
bu esa juda kuchli bog'liqlikni ko‘rsatadi (p < 0.01). [10] Emotsiyalarni boshqarish, ularni
adekvat ifoda eta olish va ularni anglash orqali ham sportda, ayniqsa o’zaro munosabatlarda
emotsional portlashlar juda ko’p bo’ladigan volleybol kabi jamoaviy sport turlarida ahamiyatli
ekanligi, sportchilarni har tomonlama intellectual rivojlantirish zaruratini ko’rsatadi.
NATIJALAR VA MUHOKAMA. Intellekt darajasi – volleybolchilarning
musobaqalardagi muvaffaqiyatli ishtiroki omili ekanligi bo’yicha mavjud farazimizni tekshirish
maqsadida, yuqoridagi tadqiqotlardan mustaqil ravishda 18 yoshgacha 17 nafar bo’lgan
volleybol bo’yicha O’zbekisotn milliy terma jamoasi a’zolari o’rtasida Raven progressive

matritsalar testi o’tkazildi. Natijalar shuni ko’rsatadiki, sportchilarning 6 nafari (35%) o’rtacha
intellekt ballarini (90 dan 110 gacha)to’play oldi, 9 nafar sportchilar (52%) quyi darajadagi
intellekt ballarini (75 dan 90 gacha) to’plagan bo’lsa, 2 (13%) nafar sportchi o’ta quyi
darajadagi intellekt ballarini (-75) to’plagan, afsuski birorta sportchi yuqori (110+) darajadagi
intellekt ballarini to’play olmagan (1-rasmga qarang).

Yuqoridagilardan kelib chiqqan holda, birorta sportchida yuqori darajadagi intellekt
natijasi ko’rsatilmaganligi, o’smirlarning umumta’lim fanlarini chuqur o’zlashtirmaganligi
bilan bog’liq deb o’ylaymiz. Bu esa o’z navbatida yetarli bilim olish uchun shart-sharoit
yaratilmaganligi, ularning o’zlarida aytarli qiziqish yoki moyillik bo’lmaganligi kabi bir qator
ijtimoiy-pedagogik omillarga bog’liq. Demak, sportchilarning ta’lim jarayoniga e’tibor
qaratish, ularning yuksak natijalari garovi bo’lishi mumkin.
Zamonaviy sport nafaqat jismoniy kuch va texnik mahoratni, balki sportchining aqliy
salohiyati, fikrlash tezligi va muammolarni hal qilish qobiliyatini ham talab qiladi. Ayniqsa,
jamoaviy sport turlari — masalan, voleybol — o‘zaro hamkorlik, strategik fikrlash va tezda
qaror qabul qilishni taqozo etadi. Progressiv matritsalar intellekt testi natijalari va volleybol
bo’yicha o’smirlar milliy terma jamoasi bosh murabbiysining sportchilarning mahorati va sport
ijrosi bo‘yicha berilgan baholar o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik ham qo’shimcha o’rganildi o‘rganiladi.
Buning uchun intellekt testidan o’tkan har bir sportchi texnik mahorati, sportchining jismoniy
chidamliligi, belgilangan ko’rsatma va taktikani oson anglash va unga rioya eta olish mahorati,
g’alabaga olib boruvchi ijodiy-improvizatsion mahorati kabi mezonlarni 5 ballik tizimda

17 nafar sportchining intellekt testi (Raven progressiv matritsalar testi) natijalari hamda
murabbiy tomonidan (uning kuzatuvlariga asoslanib) 5 ballik tizimda berilgan sport mahorati
baholari tahlil qilinganda, quyidagilarga duch kelindi:
Birinchidan, yuqori sport bahosi (3.5 yoki undan yuqori) olgan sportchilarning aksariyati
o‘z navbatida yuqori yoki o‘rtacha intellekt darajasiga ega bo‘lishdi. Jumladan, 106 ball (yuqori
intellekt) bilan 3.5 baho, 95 ball (o‘rtacha) bilan 4.5 baho, 89–86 ball oralig‘ida 3.75–4.0
baholar kuzatildi. Bu sportchilarning 71.4 foizi yuqori yoki yuqoriga yaqin intellektga ega
bo‘lgan. Biroq, barcha yuqori intellektli sportchilar yuqori sport bahosiga ega bo‘lmagan.
Masalan, 91 va 90 ballik o‘rtacha intellekt darajasiga ega sportchilardan bir nechtasi eng past
— 1.0 baho olgan. Bu holatlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, intellekt darajasi sport mahoratini to‘liq
belgilab bermaydi, balki bu faqatgina uni qo‘llab-quvvatlovchi omil bo‘lishi mumkin.
Ikkinchidan, tahlillar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, past intellektli (masalan, 62 yoki 65 ball olgan)
sportchilarda sport baholari odatda past yoki o‘rtacha bo‘lib, faqat bitta holatda (65 → 3.5)
yuqori sport bahosi kuzatilgan. Boshqa hollarda esa bu ko‘rsatkich 2.0 atrofida bo‘lgan. Bu esa
umumiy tendensiyani tasdiqlaydi: intellekt darajasi ortishi sport mahorati ko‘tarilishiga qisman
hissa qo‘shmoqda. Yuqori yoki yuqoriga yaqin intellektli sportchilarning 71.4 foizi yuqori
bahoga ega bo‘lgan. O‘rtachadan past yoki past intellektli sportchilarning 25 foizigina yuqori
105

baho olgan. Bu ko‘rsatkichlar sportchilarning intellekt darajasi va ularning sportdagi
muvaffaqiyati o‘rtasida muayyan ijobiy tendensiya mavjudligini ko‘rsatadi.
XULOSA. Sportchilarning intellektual salohiyati, ayniqsa murakkab taktik qarorlarni
qabul qilishda va o‘z-o‘zini boshqarishda muhim rol o‘ynashi mumkin. Ushbu tadqiqot
ma’lumotlari asosida aytish mumkinki, yuqori intellekt sport mahoratini oshirishda qo‘llovchi
omil sifatida xizmat qilishi mumkin. Biroq, sportda muvaffaqiyatga erishish uchun intellektdan
tashqari boshqa ko‘plab jihatlar — masalan, motivatsiya, psixologik barqarorlik, jismoniy
tayyorgarlik, taktik va texnik tajriba ham muhim ahamiyatga ega. Bundan tashqari jamoaviy
sportda sportchining emotsional va sotsial intellekti ham hal qiluvchi ahamiyat kasb etadi, zero
guruhiy dinamika barqaror kechishi uchun o’yin va mashg’ulotlarda muloqotda emotsional
tushunish, qo’llab quvvatlash, konstruktiv munosabatlar zarurat sanaladi.
Shunga qaramasdan, intellekt darajasi – volleybolchilarning musobaqalardagi
muvaffaqiyatli ishtiroki omillaridan biri sifatida ko’rib chiqilishi mumkin ekan, bo’lajak
sportchilar nafaqat antropometrik va jismoniy muvofiqlik, balki aqliy-intellektual
rivojlanganlik mezoni asosida ham saralanishi hamda shakllantirilishi maqsadga muvofiq.
Ayniqsa, umumta’lim fanlaridan tillarni o’rganish, matematika va fizika kabi sohalarida
bilimdonlik, shaxmat-shashka kabi intellektual sport turlari bilan faol tarzda shug’ullanish,
bizning fikrimizcha sportchilarni ham psixologik ham umumiy sport tayyorgarligini oliy
darajaga olib chiqishda muhim rol o’ynaydi.

KIRISH
Bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining kasbiy-shaxsiy kompetensiyalarini
rivojlantirishning psixologik xususiyatlari bugungi kunda pedagogik tizimda katta ahamiyat
kasb etmoqda. Chet el va mahalliy tajriba shuni ko‘rsatadiki, jismoniy tarbiya darslari avvalo
o‘quvchilarning sog‘lom turmush tarzini shakllantirish, jismoniy rivojlanish va sport
qobiliyatlarini yuksaltirish, eng muhimi, barkamol shaxsni shakllantirishga xizmat qiladi. Shu
boisdan, jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisi faqatgina amaliy ko‘nikmalarni bilibgina qolmay, balki
ta’lim jarayonini ongli ravishda boshqarish, psixologik-pedagogik yondashuvni qo‘llash, turli
yoshdagi bolalarning ruhiy xususiyatlarini hisobga olish va dars jarayonida motivatsiyani
uyg‘otishda yuqori darajada malakaga ega bo‘lishi kerak.
Kasbiy-shaxsiy kompetensiyalar jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisi faoliyatida muhim o‘rin
tutadi, chunki bu kompetensiyalar pedagogning nafaqat bilim va ko‘nikmalar darajasini, balki
butun shaxsiy xususiyatlarini ham o‘z ichiga oladi. Ayni vaqtda, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya
o‘qituvchisi ijtimoiy-psixologik muhitga moslasha oladigan, o‘quvchilar bilan samarali
muloqot qila oladigan, dars jarayonini ijodkorlik bilan olib bora oladigan malakali mutaxassis
bo‘lishi lozim. Shuningdek, kasbiy kompetensiya tarkibida liderlik fazilatlari, kommunikativ
ko‘nikmalar, o‘quvchilarning yosh xususiyatlariga muvofiq motivatsion strategiyalarni qo‘llash
salohiyati, konfliktlarni boshqarish, guruhiy ishonchni shakllantirish kabilar ham alohida
ahamiyatga ega.
O‘qituvchi shaxsining o‘zi ham o‘quvchilarga namuna bo‘lib xizmat qilgani bois, uning
psixologik holati, kasbiy etukligi va shaxsiy fazilatlari bevosita pedagogik jarayon sifatiga ta’sir
o‘tkazadi. Eng avvalo, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisining kasbiy shaxsiy
kompetensiyalari rivojida psixologik xususiyatlarni o‘rganish, bilish va ularga e’tibor qaratish
maqsadga muvofiqdir. Ayni shu jihat jismoniy tarbiya ta’limining samaradorligini oshirish,
o‘quvchilarning ko‘nikma va malakalarini chuqurlashtirish, sportga qiziqishlarini uyg‘otish
hamda ularni sog‘lom turmush tarziga yo‘naltirishga xizmat qiladi.
Mazkur maqolada bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilari kasbiy-shaxsiy
kompetensiyalarini rivojlantirishdagi psixologik xususiyatlar tahlil qilinadi. Bu borada
kompetensiya tushunchasi, kasbiy talablarga mos psixologik omillar, ta’lim jarayonida samarali
metodlardan foydalanish, bo‘lajak mutaxassislarda kasbiy motivatsiyani shakllantirish
masalalari va ularning yechimlari ko‘rib chiqiladi.

USULLAR
Ushbu tadqiqotda asosan kognitiv, ijtimoiy-psixologik va pedagogik metodlardan
foydalanildi. Kognitiv metodlar yordamida jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisining kasbiy-shaxsiy
kompetensiyalarining tuzilishi, funksiyalari hamda mazmuni tadqiq etildi. Xususan,
kompetensiyalarni tarkibiy qismlarga ajratish va ularning o‘zaro bog‘liqligini o‘rganish uchun
nazariy tahlil, tegishli adabiyotlarni o‘rganish, ilmiy maqolalar sharhi, jahon tajribasini
o‘rganish kabi ishlar amalga oshirildi.
Ijtimoiy-psixologik metodlar sifatida kuzatish, suhbat o‘tkazish, psixologik testlar,
so‘rovnomalar va intervyu usullaridan foydalanildi. Bunda bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya
o‘qituvchilari bilan ochiq muloqot orqali ularning kasbiy faoliyatga bo‘lgan munosabati,
shaxsiy maqsadlari, dars o‘tishdagi strategiyalari, liderlik sifati, kommunikativ ko‘nikmalari va
muammolarni hal etish qobiliyati o‘rganildi. Shuningdek, amaldagi jismoniy tarbiya
o‘qituvchilari tajribasidan kelib chiqib, ularning faoliyatidagi xulosa va tavsiyalarga murojaat
qilindi. Sinf darslarini kuzatish orqali turli yoshdagi o‘quvchilar bilan ishlashdagi real
sharoitlar, dars jarayonidagi motivatsiya usullari va pedagogning shaxsiy xususiyatlari qay
darajada dars sifatiga ta’sir ko‘rsatishi o‘rganildi.
Pedagogik metodlar esa eksperimental tadqiqotlar, o‘quv mashg‘ulotlarida
integratsiyalashgan yondashuvlarni sinab ko‘rish, o‘quvchilarning yutuqlari va natijalarini
baholash hamda tahlil qilishni o‘z ichiga oldi. Tajriba-sinov ishlarida bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya
o‘qituvchilari uchun maxsus tayyorlangan dastur sinovdan o‘tkazildi. Dasturga psixologik
treninglar, role-pley mashg‘ulotlari (rol o‘yinlari), sport darslarini innovatsion usullar bilan
tashkil etish bo‘yicha amaliy mashg‘ulotlar kiritildi.
Tadqiqotning maqsadi – bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilari kasbiy-shaxsiy
kompetensiyalarining rivojiga ta’sir qiluvchi psixologik omillarni aniqlash va ularni
shakllantirish hamda takomillashtirishga doir uslubiy ko‘rsatmalar ishlab chiqishdan iborat.
Ushbu maqsadga erishish uchun quyidagi vazifalar belgilandi:
1. Kasbiy-shaxsiy kompetensiya tushunchasining nazariy asoslarini aniqlash.
2. Bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisining kasbiy kompetensiyalari tarkibini tadqiq
etish.
3. Kasbiy kompetensiyalarni rivojlantirishdagi psixologik faktorlarni o‘rganish va
baholash mezonlarini ishlab chiqish.
4. Bo‘lajak mutaxassislarni tayyorlash jarayonida psixologik xususiyatlarni hisobga olish
bo‘yicha metodik tavsiyalar ishlab chiqish.
NATIJALAR
Tadqiqot natijalariga ko‘ra, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisining kasbiy-shaxsiy
kompetensiyalari quyidagi asosiy tarkibiy qismlardan iboratligi aniqlandi:
1. Bilimlar va ko‘nikmalar darajasi (kognitiv komponent). Ushbu komponent
o‘qituvchining anatomiya, fiziologiya, sport turlari metodikasi, sport psixologiyasi, pedagogika
kabi sohalardagi nazariy bazani qanchalik chuqur egallaganiga bog‘liq. Bilimlar bazasi chuqur
109

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

bo‘lishi jismoniy tarbiya darslarining sifatli o‘tishini ta’minlaydi, shu bilan birga, turli yoshdagi
o‘quvchilarning jismoniy va psixologik xususiyatlariga mos ta’lim metodlarini tanlashga
yordam beradi.
2. Motivatsiya va kasbiy qiziqish (motivatsion komponent). Tadqiqot davomida
bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining o‘z kasbiga bo‘lgan qiziqishi, shaxsiy maqsadlari
va motivlari, sport bilan shug‘ullanishdan oladigan hissiy holati kabi jihatlar atroflicha
o‘rganildi. Natijalar shuni ko‘rsatdiki, kasbiy motivatsiyasi yuqori darajada rivojlangan
talabalar pedagogik amaliyot jarayonida ham faol, ijodkor, muammolarni hal etishga
intiluvchan bo‘lib, tezda jamoaga moslasha olishi qayd etildi.
3. Kommunikativ qobiliyatlar (kommunikativ komponent). Sinov davrida suhbat va
intervyu usullaridan foydalanish orqali bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining muloqotda
ochiqlik darajasi, fikrni aniq va ravon ifodalash qobiliyati, o‘quvchilar bilan til topa olish san’ati
hamda bahs-munozaralardan to‘g‘ri xulosa chiqara olish ko‘nikmalari baholandi. Natijalar
shuni ko‘rsatdiki, kommunikativ qobiliyati yaxshi rivojlangan talabalar hamkasblari va
o‘quvchilari bilan osongina muloqotga kirishadi, dars jarayonida hamkorlik muhitini yarata
oladi.
4. Liderlik va tashkiliy salohiyat (xulq-atvoriy komponent). O‘qituvchi dars
jarayonida nafaqat bilim beruvchi, balki yetakchilik qiluvchi, o‘quvchilarning birgalikdagi
faoliyatini boshqaruvchi shaxs sifatida namoyon bo‘ladi. Tadqiqot davomida psixologik
treninglar va role-pley mashg‘ulotlari yordamida bo‘lajak pedagoglarning liderlik, tashkiliy
mahorati va mas’uliyatni zimmasiga ola bilish qobiliyati baholandi. Ushbu komponent yuqori
bo‘lgan talabalar o‘quvchilar bilan ishlashda mas’uliyatli, intizomli, maqsad sari intiluvchan
bo‘lib, sinf jamoasini yaxshi boshqara oldi.
5. Muammolarni hal qilish va ijodkorlik (ijodiy komponent). Jismoniy tarbiya
darslarida turli xil vaziyatlar kelib chiqishi mumkin: o‘quvchilarning har xil motivatsiya
darajasi, ba’zi sport mashqlarini o‘zlashtira olmasligi yoki sog‘ligidagi cheklovlar, guruh
ichidagi nizolar va hokazo. Bunday holatlarda ijodkorlik, tezkor qaror qabul qilish, muammoni
to‘g‘ri tahlil qilish va adekvat javob choralari ko‘rish zarur. Tadqiqot natijalariga ko‘ra, ijodiy
kompetensiyaga ega talabalar noodatiy usullarni qo‘llash, darsni jonlantiruvchi interaktiv
metodlarni tatbiq etishga moyil ekani kuzatildi.
Yuqoridagi komponentlarning rivojlanishi o‘qituvchining kasbiy faolligiga va dars
sifatiga bevosita ta’sir qiladi. Tadqiqot jarayonida olingan so‘rovnomalar tahlili shuni
ko‘rsatdiki, talabalarning ko‘pchiligida motivatsion komponent yaxshi rivojlangan bo‘lsada,
ayrimlarida kommunikativ va liderlik ko‘nikmalarida ojizliklar bor. Shu boisdan, bo‘lajak
jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarini tayyorlash jarayonida ana shu zaif jihatlarga alohida e’tibor
qaratish lozimligi aniqlandi.
MUNOZARA
Tadqiqotdan kelib chiqadigan asosiy xulosa shuki, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilari
110

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

kasbiy-shaxsiy kompetensiyalarini rivojlantirishda psixologik xususiyatlarni e’tibordan chetda
qoldirish mumkin emas. Avvalo, bu borada quyidagi omillarni ko‘rib chiqish zarur:
Birinchidan, motivatsiya. Talabalarda kasbga bo‘lgan ijobiy munosabatni, yetuklikka
intilishni va yosh avlod tarbiyasida o‘z hissasini qo‘shish istagini shakllantirish muhimdir.
Motivatsiyasi baland bo‘lgan shaxs o‘zini doimiy ravishda takomillashtirib boradi, shaxsiy
fazilatlarini chuqurlashtirishga intiladi. Jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisining o‘zi sport bilan
muntazam shug‘ullanadigan, hayotiy faol, pozitiv psixologik ruhdagi inson bo‘lishi motivatsiya
manbai sifatida xizmat qiladi.
Ikkinchidan, kommunikativ kompetensiya. Dars jarayonida o‘qituvchi o‘quvchilar
bilan yuzma-yuz muloqot qiladi, ularga ta’sir o‘tkazadi, rag‘batlantiradi yoki tanbeh beradi.
Agar o‘qituvchida kommunikativ ko‘nikmalar yuqori darajada bo‘lmasa, dars mazmunini
to‘g‘ri tushuntirish, o‘quvchilarni ruhlantirish, ulardagi tashabbus va qiziqishni qo‘llabquvvatlash qiyinlashadi. Shuningdek, sinf jamoasi bilan samarali ishlash, bahs-munozaralar
vaqtida to‘g‘ri xulosa chiqara bilish ham to‘g‘ridan-to‘g‘ri kommunikativ kompetensiyaga
bog‘liq.
Uchinchidan, liderlik va tashkilotchilik fazilatlari. Jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisi
nafaqat bilim bera olishi, balki sinf guruhini boshqarishi, intizomni saqlashi, dars jarayonida
paydo bo‘lgan nizolarni hal etishi, bolalar energiyasini samarali yo‘naltirishi shart. Shu bois,
bo‘lajak pedagoglarda liderlik ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirish uchun maxsus treninglar, guruhiy
mashg‘ulotlar, rol o‘yinlari tashkil etish zarur. Tadqiqot tajribasi shuni ko‘rsatdiki, bunday
mashg‘ulotlar orqali talabalar o‘zlarini yetakchi sifatida ko‘rsatishga, tashabbus ko‘rsatishga,
jamoani boshqarishga intilishi kuchayadi.
To‘rtinchidan, ijodkorlik. Bir xil saboq yoki sport mashqlarini doimiy takrorlash
o‘quvchilarda zerikish hissini uyg‘otishi mumkin. Jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisi dars jarayoniga
ijodiy yondashsa, turli metodlar va o‘yin uslublaridan foydalansa, o‘quvchilarning qiziqishi va
faolligi ortadi. Zero, darsning interaktiv tarzda tashkil etilishi, yangi sport texnikalari yoki
kichik musobaqalar o‘quvchilarni rag‘batlantiradi, raqobat muhitini yaratib, ularga o‘zlarini
sinab ko‘rish imkonini beradi.
Beshinchidan, o‘z-o‘zini rivojlantirish, refleksiya. Pedagogik faoliyat doirasida
o‘qituvchi muntazam ravishda o‘z darslarini tahlil qilib, nimalar yaxshi chiqdi, nimani yanada
takomillashtirish kerakligini aniqlab borishi zarur. Buning uchun o‘qituvchi psixologik
bilimlarga ega bo‘lishi, o‘z-o‘zini tahlil qilish, o‘zdagi zaif va kuchli jihatlarni aniqlash va ularni
bartaraf etish yoki kuchaytirish usullarini bilishi zarur. Bu jarayonda hamkasblar bilan tajriba
almashish, seminar-treninglarda qatnashish, zamonaviy adabiyotlar bilan tanishish, onlayn
platformalardan foydalangan holda malaka oshirish kabilar katta ahamiyatga ega.
Yuqoridagi omillarni hisobga olgan holda, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilari
kasbiy-shaxsiy kompetensiyalarini rivojlantirishning psixologik jihatlarini puxta o‘rganish va
ularni tayyorlash jarayonida kompleks yondashuv zarurligi ko‘rinib turibdi. Bunda
universitetlarda mo‘ljallangan dasturlarni boyitish, nazariy fanlar bilan amaliy mashg‘ulotlar
111

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

o‘rtasida mutanosiblikni to‘g‘ri tashkil etish, ilg‘or xorijiy tajribaga asoslangan trening va
seminarlarni joriy etish muhimdir.
XULOSA
Yuqoridagi tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilari
kasbiy-shaxsiy kompetensiyalarining shakllanishi va rivojlanishida psixologik xususiyatlar
alohida o‘rin tutadi. Bu xususiyatlar motivatsion, kommunikativ, liderlik, ijodiy va shaxsiy
refleksiv komponentlarga bo‘linishi mumkin. Mazkur komponentlarning har biri jismoniy
tarbiya o‘qituvchisining kasbiy faoliyatiga o‘z ta’sirini o‘tkazadi va darslar samaradorligini
oshirishda muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi.
Mazkur jarayonda eng muhimi, bo‘lajak pedagogning o‘zi sport faoliyatiga mehr bilan
qarashi, o‘z malakasini doimiy ravishda oshirib borishi, zamonaviy ta’lim texnologiyalaridan
foydalana olishi va o‘quvchilarning individual xususiyatlarini hisobga olgan holda dars
jarayonini boshqarishidir. Shuningdek, psixologik jihatdan tayyorgarlik jarayonida trening,
seminar, rol o‘yinlari va boshqa interaktiv metodlardan keng foydalanish tavsiya etiladi. Zero,
bu nafaqat talabalarning nazariy bilimlarini mustahkamlaydi, balki ularning shaxsiy sifatlari,
liderlik, guruhda ishlash, konfliktlarni hal etish, ijodiy fikrlash kabi ko‘nikmalarini ham
rivojlantiradi.
Kelajakda
bo‘lajak
jismoniy
tarbiya
o‘qituvchilarining
kasbiy-shaxsiy
kompetensiyalarini rivojlantirishga qaratilgan ilmiy-amaliy tadqiqotlar ko‘lamini kengaytirish,
ular asosida samarali metodik tavsiyalar ishlab chiqish va bu jarayonni uzluksiz davom ettirish
maqsadga muvofiqdir. Bunday yondashuv, o‘z navbatida, nafaqat ta’lim sifatini, balki xalqimiz
salomatligini mustahkamlashga, yoshlar orasida sog‘lom turmush tarzini targ‘ib qilishga,
ularning jismoniy va ma’naviy barkamol bo‘lib voyaga yetishlariga xizmat qiladi.
Shu o‘rinda, oliy ta’lim muassasalari, ta’lim boshqaruv organlari hamda sport
federatsiyalari hamkorlikda jismoniy tarbiya sohasida pedagog kadrlarni tayyorlash dasturlarini
takomillashtirishi, ilg‘or xorijiy tajribani mahalliy sharoitga moslashtirishi, bo‘lajak
o‘qituvchilarning kasbiy kompetensiyalarini rivojlantirishga yo‘naltirilgan trening, seminar va
amaliy mashg‘ulotlarni tashkil etishlari lozim. Ana shu sa’y-harakatlar jismoniy tarbiya
o‘qituvchisi faoliyatining samaradorligi va ta’lim jarayonida yuqori natijalarga erishish
imkoniyatlarini oshiradi.
Umuman olganda, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining kasbiy-shaxsiy
kompetensiyalarini rivojlantirishning psixologik xususiyatlarini e’tiborga olish – bu bugungi
ta’lim tizimidagi ustuvor yo‘nalishlardan biri bo‘lib, mazkur jarayonni to‘g‘ri tashkil etish
orqali jamiyatimizda sog‘lom avlodni tarbiyalash, ularning jismoniy faolligini ta’minlash va
kelajakda yetuk mutaxassislar, yetakchilarni yetishtirish imkonini beradi.

KIRISH
O‘smirlik davri inson hayotidagi eng murakkab, qarama-qarshi va o‘zgaruvchan
bosqichlardan biridir. Aynan shu davrda shaxsiy xususiyatlar, qadriyatlar, dunyoqarash va
xarakter shakllana boshlaydi. Bu jarayonning murakkabligi shundaki, o‘smirlar o‘zlarini
anglashga, atrof-muhit bilan munosabat o‘rnatishga va mustaqil shaxs sifatida namoyon
bo‘lishga intiladi. Bu esa ularning psixologik holatida muayyan zo‘riqishlar, ichki ziddiyatlar
va xarakterda keskin o‘zgarishlarga olib kelishi mumkin.
Shaxsning xarakteri hayot davomida barqarorlik kasb etsa-da, o‘smirlikda u tez-tez
o‘zgaruvchan va ta’sirchan bo‘ladi. Psixologik adabiyotlarda “xarakter aksentuatsiyasi”
tushunchasi shaxsning muayyan xarakter xususiyatlarining haddan tashqari kuchayib, normal
holatga yaqin, biroq chekka shaklga o‘tishini anglatadi. Bu holat o‘smirlarning shaxsiy
rivojlanishida muhim rol o‘ynaydi va ularning ijtimoiy muhitga moslashuvi, o‘zini tutishi
hamda kelajakdagi shaxsiy rivojlanish yo‘nalishiga sezilarli ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Mazkur maqolada o‘smirlarda xarakter aksentuatsiyasining shakllanishiga ta’sir
ko‘rsatuvchi ijtimoiy-psixologik omillar tahlil qilinadi. Shu jumladan, oila muhiti, do‘stlar
guruhi, maktabdagi munosabatlar, ommaviy axborot vositalari va internet kabi tashqi muhit
omillarining roli ko‘rib chiqiladi.
Tadqiqot vazifalari:
1.
Xarakter aksentuatsiyasi tushunchasining nazariy asoslarini ko‘rib chiqish;
2.
O‘smirlik davri psixologik xususiyatlarini tahlil qilish;
3.
Ijtimoiy muhit omillarining aksentuatsiyaga ta’sirini aniqlash;
4.
Amaliy tavsiyalar ishlab chiqish.
O‘smirlik davrida xarakter aksentuatsiyasiga ta’sir ko‘rsatuvchi ijtimoiy-psixologik
omillar. Xarakter shaxsning barqaror psixologik xususiyatlari majmui bo‘lib, u insonning
harakatlari, munosabatlari va tashqi dunyo bilan bo‘lgan aloqalarini belgilaydi. Har bir insonda
xarakter o‘ziga xos tarzda shakllanadi va turli tashqi hamda ichki omillar ta’sirida rivojlanadi.

O‘smirlik davri aynan xarakterning shakllanishi va mustahkamlanishida asosiy bosqich
hisoblanadi.
Psixologiyada "xarakter aksentuatsiyasi" tushunchasi birinchi marta Karl Leonhard
tomonidan fanga kiritilgan bo‘lib, u bu atama orqali shaxsda mavjud bo‘lgan ayrim xarakter
xususiyatlarining haddan tashqari kuchayib, ekstremal darajaga yetishini tushuntirgan. Biroq bu
holat patologiya (kasallik) darajasiga yetmaydi va ko‘pincha ijtimoiy sharoitlarga qarab o‘zini
namoyon qiladi. Leonhard o‘z tadqiqotlarida aksentuatsiyalarning turli turlarini ajratgan:
gipertimik, distimik, affektiv-labil, demonstrativ, pedantik va boshqalar.
Keyinchalik rus psixiatri Andrey Lichko ushbu nazariyani yanada chuqurlashtirib,
ayniqsa o‘smirlar misolida xarakter aksentuatsiyalarini o‘rganishga alohida e’tibor qaratgan. U
o‘smirlar uchun xos bo‘lgan 10 dan ortiq aksentuatsiya turini aniqlagan, jumladan:
 Gipertimik tip – faol, ijobiy, lekin beqarorlik bilan ajralib turadi;
 Senzitiv tip – sezgir, xavotirli, o‘ziga ishonchsiz;
 Affektiv-eksploziv tip – jizzaki, tez asabiylashuvchi;
 Demonstrativ tip – diqqat markazida bo‘lishni istovchi, dramatik reaktsiyalarga
moyil;
 Introvert tip – o‘ziga tortilgan, yolg‘izlikni afzal ko‘ruvchi.
Lichkoga ko‘ra, aksentuatsiyalar sog‘lom shaxsda ham uchrashi mumkin va bu holat
o‘smirlik davrida ayniqsa kuchli namoyon bo‘ladi. Bu yoshda shaxsiy o‘zgarishlar, gormonal
silkinishlar, ijtimoiy bosimlar, mustaqillikka intilish kuchaygan bo‘lishi sababli, xarakterning
ayrim jihatlari haddan tashqari kuchayadi va bu holat vaqtinchalik yoki doimiy bo‘lishi
mumkin.[3]
Xarakter aksentuatsiyasi mavjud bo‘lgan o‘smirlar ko‘pincha ijtimoiy muhitga sezgir
bo‘lib, tashqi ta’sirlarga kuchli javob qaytaradi. Ular do‘stlar bosimiga tez tushadi, oilaviy
muhitga nisbatan sezuvchan bo‘ladi va psixologik yordamga ehtiyoj sezadi. Shuning uchun ham
bunday o‘smirlar bilan ishlashda individual yondashuv muhim hisoblanadi.

o‘zaro aloqasi yanada faol va murakkab shaklga ega bo‘ladi. Ayniqsa, oila va maktab
muhitining o‘smir psixikasiga ko‘rsatadigan ta’siri sezilarli darajada bo‘ladi. [2]
Oilaning tasiri

Ota-onaning tarbiya uslublari: avtoritar (qat’iy), befarq (e’tiborsiz), haddan
tashqari erkalatuvchi yoki ortiqcha nazorat qiluvchi tarbiya uslublari o‘smirning shaxsiy
xususiyatlariga salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Masalan, doimiy nazorat va tanqid ostida bo‘lgan
o‘smirda senzitiv yoki affektiv-labil tipdagi aksentuatsiyalar rivojlanishi mumkin.

Oila ichidagi nizolar va ziddiyatlar: ota-onaning o‘zaro munosabatidagi
beqarorlik, janjallar, ajrimlar o‘smirda xavotir, tajovuzkorlik, yoki ijtimoiy izolyatsiya kabi
holatlarga olib keladi.

Emotsional qo‘llab-quvvatlovning yetishmasligi: e’tibor va mehrdan mosuvo
o‘smirlar o‘zini yolg‘iz his qiladi, bu esa introvert yoki demonstrativ tipdagi
aksentuatsiyalarning rivojlanishiga sabab bo‘ladi.
Maktab muhitining ta’siri

O‘qituvchilar bilan munosabatlar: o‘qituvchining o‘quvchiga bo‘lgan
munosabati — hurmat, ishonch, yoki aksincha — tanqid, e’tiborsizlik kabi omillar o‘smirning
o‘z-o‘ziga bo‘lgan bahosiga va xarakteriga ta’sir qiladi. Haddan tashqari talabchan yoki loqayd
o‘qituvchi aksentuatsiyalarning kuchayishiga turtki bo‘lishi mumkin.

Muvaffaqiyat va muvaffaqiyatsizliklar: o‘quv jarayonida yutuq yoki
mag‘lubiyatlar o‘smirda o‘ziga ishonch, motivatsiya yoki tushkunlik holatini shakllantiradi.
Masalan, doimiy muvaffaqiyatsizliklar senzitiv tipdagi aksentuatsiyani kuchaytiradi.

Sinfdoshlar bilan ijtimoiy munosabatlar: do‘stlar o‘rtasidagi o‘zaro munosabat,
liderlik pozitsiyasi, tengdoshlar bosimi o‘smirning xarakterida muayyan o‘zgarishlar qilishi
mumkin. Ba’zi o‘smirlar guruhda moslashishga harakat qilib, o‘ziga xos xatti-harakatlarini
yashiradi yoki ataylab keskin xatti-harakatlar ko‘rsatadi.
Do‘stlar guruhi va tengdoshlar ta’siri
O‘smirlik davrida do‘stlar guruhi shaxsiy ijtimoiylashuvning markaziga aylanadi.
O‘smirlar bu bosqichda ota-onalardan ko‘ra, do‘stlari bilan ko‘proq vaqt o‘tkazadi, ular bilan
o‘z fikrini muvofiqlashtiradi, o‘zini baholaydi va shaxsiy o‘zgarishlarga yo‘l qo‘yadi.[4]

Ijtimoiy moslashuv bosimi: do‘stlar guruhiga “moslashish” ehtiyoji o‘smirni o‘z
xarakterini yashirishga yoki unga zid bo‘lgan xatti-harakatlarni namoyon qilishga majbur qiladi.
Bu holat demonstrativ, affektiv-eksploziv yoki konform tipdagi aksentuatsiyalarning
kuchayishiga olib kelishi mumkin.

Noqonuniy yoki xavfli guruhlarga qo‘shilish: o‘zini oilada yoki maktabda
tushunilmagan deb hisoblagan o‘smirlar ko‘pincha norasmiy, ba’zida esa ijtimoiy jihatdan
xavfli bo‘lgan guruhlar ta’siriga tushadi. Bu esa shaxsiy agressiya, qarama-qarshilikka moyillik
va jamiyatga zid pozitsiyalarni shakllantiradi.
117

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Yetakchilar ta’siri: guruh ichida faol, dominant o‘smirlar boshqa tengdoshlar
xarakterining shakllanishida sezilarli rol o‘ynaydi. Ular ko‘pincha “model shaxs” sifatida qabul
qilinadi.
Ommaviy axborot vositalari va internetning roli
Virtual hayot va haqiqiylik o‘rtasidagi ziddiyat: ijtimoiy tarmoqlarda yaratilgan
“ideal obrazlar” o‘smirni o‘zini past baholashga yoki sun’iy ko‘rinishga intilishiga undaydi. Bu
esa demonstrativ va senzitiv aksentuatsiyalarni kuchaytiradi.

Zo‘ravonlik va tajovuzni targ‘ib qiluvchi kontent: kompyuter o‘yinlari,
videolar, yangiliklar yoki kino orqali beriladigan salbiy axborot o‘smirlar ruhiyatida befarqlik,
tajovuzkorlik yoki ijtimoiy moslashuvdagi muammolarga olib kelishi mumkin.

Ijtimoiy izolyatsiya va yolg‘izlik: doimiy ravishda internetga “qochish” o‘smirni
haqiqiy ijtimoiy munosabatlardan uzoqlashtiradi, bu esa introvert, senzitiv yoki affektiv-labil
tipdagi aksentuatsiyalar rivojlanishiga olib keladi.
Shu sababli ota-onalar, o‘qituvchilar va psixologlar o‘smirlarning virtual faoliyati ustidan
ehtiyotkorlik bilan kuzatuv olib borishlari, ularni real ijtimoiy hayotda faol ishtirok etishga
undashlari lozim
Natijalar taxlili
Mazkur mavzu bo‘yicha o‘tkazilgan kuzatuv va ilmiy manbalarga tayangan holda,
o‘smirlar xarakter aksentuatsiyasiga ijtimoiy-psixologik omillar qanday ta’sir qilishi haqida
umumiy xulosalar chiqarish mumkin. Quyida shunga doir tipik misollar va tahlillar keltiriladi.
1. Oila muhiti va senzitiv aksentuatsiya
Misol: 14 yoshli o‘quvchi A. oilasida sovuqqon, emotsional aloqasi sust bo‘lgan
muhitda tarbiyalangan. Ota-onasi band, bolaning hissiy ehtiyojlariga javob bermaydi.
O‘quvchining o‘ziga ishonchi past, begona odamlardan uyalanadi, tengdoshlar orasida o‘zini
noqulay his qiladi.
Tahlil: Bu holatda sezgir (senzitiv) tipdagi aksentuatsiya rivojlanayotganini ko‘rish
mumkin. Bolaning o‘ziga past baho berishi va ijtimoiy izolyatsiyaga moyilligi befarq oilaviy
munosabatlar bilan bog‘liq.
Tengdoshlar guruhi va demonstrativ aksentuatsiya
Misol: 15 yoshli B. do‘stlar orasida e’tibor markazida bo‘lishga harakat qiladi,
ko‘pincha o‘zini bo‘rttirib ko‘rsatadi, yolg‘on so‘zlashga moyil, o‘qituvchilar oldida o‘zini
boshqa qilib ko‘rsatadi.
Tahlil: B. demonstrativ aksentuatsiya tipiga mansub bo‘lishi mumkin. Bu holatda
do‘stlar guruhidagi ijtimoiy bosim va maqom uchun kurash asosiy omil sifatida namoyon
bo‘lgan.[5]
Internet ta’siri va introvert aksentuatsiya
Misol: 13 yoshli V. ko‘p vaqtini kompyuter o‘yinlariga va ijtimoiy tarmoqlarga
bag‘ishlaydi. U haqiqiy hayotdagi do‘stlardan qochadi, maktabdagi faoliyatga qiziqmaydi.
Ko‘proq yolg‘iz qolishni afzal ko‘radi.


118

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Tahlil: Virtual olamga haddan ortiq berilish natijasida V.da introvert tipdagi
xarakter aksentuatsiyasi shakllanmoqda. Bu, o‘z navbatida, ijtimoiy izolyatsiyani kuchaytiradi.
Maktabdagi muvaffaqiyatsizlik va affektiv-labil aksentuatsiya
Misol: 14 yoshli D. o‘qishda qiyinchilikka uchraydi, o‘qituvchilarning tanqidiga
sezgir, kayfiyati tez-tez o‘zgaradi, ba’zida asabiylashadi yoki yig‘lab yuboradi.
Tahlil: D.da affektiv-labil tipdagi aksentuatsiyaning belgilari mavjud. Maktabdagi
muvaffaqiyatsizliklar, o‘qituvchilarning bosimi va psixologik qo‘llab-quvvatlovning yo‘qligi
bu holatni kuchaytirmoqda.
Kuzatuvlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, xarakter aksentuatsiyasi o‘smirlarning ichki psixologik
jihatlarigina emas, balki ular yashayotgan tashqi ijtimoiy muhit tomonidan ham faol
shakllanadi. Shuning uchun aksentuatsiya faqat individual xususiyat sifatida emas, balki
ijtimoiy-psixologik ta’sirlarning mahsuli sifatida ham qaralishi zarur.
Psixoprofilaktika va amaliy tavsiyalar
Xarakter aksentuatsiyasining mavjudligi har doim ham muammo yoki patologiya emas.
Ammo bu holat o‘smirning noto‘g‘ri ijtimoiy sharoitlarda salbiy xatti-harakatlar ko‘rsatishiga
sabab bo‘lishi mumkin. Shuning uchun profilaktik choralar va to‘g‘ri yondashuv
aksentuatsiyaning salbiy tomoni kuchaymasligida muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi.
Oila uchun tavsiyalar
 Ijobiy emotsional muhit yaratish – oila a’zolari o‘smirga mehr, tushunish va hurmat
asosida munosabatda bo‘lishi kerak. Bu o‘smirning o‘ziga ishonchini oshiradi.
 Tarbiya muvozanatini saqlash – haddan tashqari qat’iylik yoki befarqlik emas, balki
izchil va muvozanatli tarbiya samarali bo‘ladi.
 Ochiq muloqotga undash – o‘smirning fikri, his-tuyg‘ulari inobatga olinib, u bilan
do‘stona va ochiq suhbatlar o‘tkazilishi zarur.
Maktab psixologi va o‘qituvchilar uchun tavsiyalar
 Individuallashtirilgan yondashuv – har bir o‘quvchining xarakter xususiyatlarini
inobatga olgan holda, unga mos metodlar bilan ishlash kerak.
 Ijtimoiy moslashuv dasturlari – sinf jamoasida muloqotni rivojlantirish, jamoaviy
ishlarni tashkil etish orqali o‘smirlarni faol ijtimoiy hayotga jalb qilish lozim.
 Stressni kamaytiruvchi texnikalar – maktabda relaksatsiya mashqlari, kreativ
mashg‘ulotlar, art-terapiya va psixologik treninglar o‘tkazilishi foydali bo‘ladi.
O‘smirlar uchun psixoprofilaktik tavsiyalar
 O‘z-o‘zini anglash va nazorat qilish ko‘nikmalari – o‘smirlarga o‘z histuyg‘ularini tan olish, tahlil qilish va boshqarish bo‘yicha psixologik yordam ko‘rsatish kerak.
 Sog‘lom ijtimoiy muhit yaratish – do‘stlik, jamoada ishlash, empatiya va
bag‘rikenglikni rivojlantirish orqali shaxslararo munosabatlarni mustahkamlash lozim.
 Sport va ijodiy faoliyatga jalb etish – sport, musiqa, rasm, drama to‘garaklariga
qatnashish o‘smirning energiyasini ijobiy kanalga yo‘naltiradi. [3]
119

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Internet va OAV bilan ishlash bo‘yicha tavsiyalar
 Axborot madaniyatini shakllantirish – o‘smirlarga media savodxonlik, axborotni
tanlash va baholash ko‘nikmalarini o‘rgatish lozim.
 Ijtimoiy tarmoqlardagi faoliyatni nazorat qilish – nazorat jazolash shaklida emas,
balki ishonchli muloqot orqali olib borilishi lozim.
Xarakter aksentuatsiyasi o‘smirning shaxsiy rivojlanishida katta ahamiyatga ega bo‘lgan
psixologik holat bo‘lib, u atrof-muhit, oilaviy sharoitlar, maktab va ijtimoiy muloqotlarning
ta’siri ostida shakllanadi. Aksentuatsiya o‘ziga xos xususiyatlar bo‘lib, o‘smirning psixikasida
ba’zi tendensiyalarning o‘zgarishiga olib keladi, lekin ularning o‘zi patologik holatlarni keltirib
chiqarmaydi. Biroq, aksentuatsiya noto‘g‘ri tarbiya, ijtimoiy bosim va ijtimoiy izolyatsiya
holatlarida salbiy ta’sirlar ko‘rsatishi mumkin.
Ijtimoiy-psixologik omillarning ahamiyati
O‘smirlar xarakterining shakllanishida ijtimoiy-psixologik omillar muhim o‘rin tutadi.
Oila, maktab, tengdoshlar guruhi, va internet – bu omillar o‘smirning xarakterini
shakllantiruvchi kuchli ijtimoiy omillardir. Oila muhitida yoshlar o‘zlariga qanday xattiharakatlarni model sifatida tanlashni o‘rganishadi, maktabda esa ular o‘qituvchilar va
tengdoshlar bilan o‘zaro munosabatlarni rivojlantiradilar. Do‘stlar guruhi va ijtimoiy tarmoqlar
o‘smirlarning xarakterini shakllantirishda sezilarli darajada ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Shu sababli,
o‘smirlar bilan ishlashda ijtimoiy muhitingi yodda tutish zarur.[2]
Psixoprofilaktika va amaliy tavsiyalar
Aksentuatsiyalarning salbiy oqibatlarini kamaytirish uchun psixoprofilaktika tadbirlari,
ya’ni profilaktik ishlar o‘tkazish zarur. O‘smirlarni psixologik jihatdan qo‘llab-quvvatlash,
ularga stressni boshqarish, ijtimoiy moslashuvni kuchaytirish, va o‘z his-tuyg‘ularini tan olishda
yordam berish ularning shaxsiy rivojlanishida muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Oila, maktab va ijtimoiy
tarmoqlarda sog‘lom muhit yaratish, o‘smirlarni ijtimoiy faoliyatga jalb etish va ijobiy
axborotlarni taqdim etish aksentuatsiyaning salbiy ta’sirlarini kamaytiradi.
Yakuniy xulosa
Xarakter aksentuatsiyasi o‘smirlar rivojlanishining muhim qismi bo‘lib, ijtimoiypsixologik omillar tomonidan shakllanadi. O‘smirlarning psixologik barqarorligini ta’minlash,
ularning xarakterini to‘g‘ri rivojlantirish uchun oilada, maktabda, va jamiyatda ma’lum choralar
ko‘rilishi zarur. Aksentuatsiyaning ijtimoiy va psixologik jihatlarini inobatga olgan holda, uning
salbiy oqibatlari oldini olish mumkin, bu esa o‘smirlarning kelajakda ijtimoiy muhitga
muvaffaqiyatli integratsiyasiga yordam beradi.

Kirish. Jahonda zamonaviy jamiyatning rivojlanishi barcha sohalarga innovatsiyalarning
kiritilishi bilan belgilanib, oliy o'quv yurtlariga bir qator yangi talablarni qo'yishi, oliy o'quv
yurtlari bitiruvchilarining mehnat bozori talablariga mos kelishiga imkon beradigan zarur
kompetensiyalarni egallashi uchun shart-sharoit yaratish harakatlari mutaxassislarni sifatli
tayyorlash zarurati bilan bog'liqligi e’tirof etiladi.[10] Shuningdek, oliy o‘quv yurtlarida mobil
mutaxassislarni tayyorlash masalasi alohida ahamiyat kasb etayotganligi ushbu maqsadlarda
zamonaviy mobil texnologiyalardan foydalanish ta’limning muhim vositasi sifatida
qaralmoqda. Shu nuqtai nazardan raqobatbardosh, mobil mutaxassislarni tayyorlash uchun
ta'lim jarayoni, innovatsion ta'lim muhiti mutaxassisning kompetentsiyalarini shakllantirish
zarurati sifatida o‘rganish dolzarbdir. Pedagog, psixolog, sotsiolog va boshqa soha vakillari
tomonidan mazkur masalani o‘rganish va bartaraf etishning asosiy manbasi ta’lim va tarbiyani
innovatsion ta’lim muhitini shakllantirishning konseptual g‘oyalariga muvofiq, zamonaviy
pedagogik texnologiyalar asosida tashkil etishga ustuvorlik berish lozimligiga e’tibor
qaratmoqda.
Ta’lim muhitiga innovatsion yondashuv va ilmiy adabiyotlar tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki,
globallashuv jarayonining dastlabki paytlarida mobil mutaxassis tayyorlash, uning asl
mohiyatini anglash hamda demokratik tamoyillar ustuvorligi nuqtai nazarida ta’limni tashkil
etish muhim masala hisoblanadi.
Jahonda pedagogik oliy ta’lim muassasalari talabalarini mobil mutaxassislar qilib
shakllantirishda mobil texnologiyalarga asoslahgan ta’lim muhitini yaratishga, fanlarni o‘qitish
metodikasi va metodologiyasini hamda talabalar faoliyatini mobil texnologiyalar asosida tashkil
etishning psixologik-pedagogik sharoitlarini yaratish zarurati ortmoqda.[9]
Pedagogik oliy ta’lim muassasalarida innovatsion ta'lim muhiti talabalarning chuqur bilim
olishi, bo‘lajak o‘qituvchilarda innovatsion va ijodiy fikrlash qobiliyati yuksak kadrlar etib
shakllantirishni hamda ularning kasbiy kompetentsiyasi rivojini ta'minlaydigan o'zaro uyg‘un
shart-sharoitlarn yaratilgan ta’lim majmuasidir.
Fan va texnologik taraqqiyotning jadal rivojlanishi, ijtimoiy taraqqiyot qonunlariga mos
ravishda mobil texnologiyalardan ta'lim maqsadlarida foydalanish prognozini belgilasada,
bugungi kunda oliy ta’lim muassasalarida innovatsion ta’lim muhitini yaratish va talabalarning
innovatsion ta’lim muhitidan samarali foydalanishi hamda pedagog kadrlarning jarayonni
boshqarish bo‘yicha zarur kompitensiyalarining yetarli darajada emasligi kabilar bu borada
muammolarni keltirib chiqarayotganligi tufayli alohida dolzarblik kasb etmoqda.

Shuningdek, globallashuv oqibatlari natijasi sifatida rivojlanayotgan mamlakatlarga
mehnat migratsiyasi tufayli subsidiyalangan hududlarda ishsizlikni ko‘payishi, tug‘ilishni
pasayishi, atrof-muhit degradatsiyasi, milliy korxonalar va transmilliy korporatsiyalar
o‘rtasidagi yuqori raqobat, bozorlarni monopollashuvining kuchayishi hamda iqtisodiy
tafovutning oshishiga olib keladi. Globallashuv jamiyat milliy boyligi bo‘lgan ijodiy halokat
sur’atlarini tezlashtiradi, odamlar va umuman jamiyat hayotning yangi shakllariga moslashishga
nisbatan agressiyani keltirib chiqaradi hamda jamiyatda hukm surayotgan ideallar, qadriyatlar
va an’analarni chiqarib tashlaydi. Mazkur masalani mobil mutaxassislarni tayyorlash orqali
bartaraf etish masalasi kun tartibiga chiqishi tabiiy holdir.
Informatsion jamiyatning real voqeligi, barchamizni bugungi kundagi o‘zgarishlarga ongli
va ratsional omillar nuqtai nazarida yondashuvni taqozo etgan holda, millatlar, xalqlar,
davlatlar, umuman insoniyatning ma’naviy hayot haqidagi qarashlari, konsepsiyalari, g‘oya va
mafkuralar, individual va ijtimoiy fikrlari o‘rtasidagi munosabatlar g‘oyat murakkab, hatto,
ayrim hollarda, ziddiyatliligini namoyon qilmoqda.
Jamiyatimizda kechayotgan integratsion taraqqiyotning yoshlar tarbiyasi, kasbiy
yo‘nalganligi va ilmiy salohiyatiga ta’sirini o‘rganishda sotsiolog, psixolog, ma’naviyat,
pedagog va gumanitar soha mutaxassislarini tashvishlantirayotgan muammolardan biri
“kosmopolitizm g‘oyasi” va “ommaviy madaniyat” bo‘lib qolayotganligi hech kimga sir emas.
O‘zbekistonda oliy ta'limni tizimli isloh qilish, uni jahon standartlari asosida qayta
shakllantirish ustuvor yo‘nalishlardan biri hisoblanadi. Yoshlarga zamonaviy bilim berish,
ularda yuksak ma'naviy-axloqiy fazilatlarni shakllabtirish, mustaqil fikrlaydigan yuqori
malakali kadrlar tayyorlash jarayonini sifat jihatidan yangi bosqichga ko‘tarish, oliy ta'limni
modernizatsiya qilish, ilg‘or ta'lim texnologiyalariga asoslangan holda ijtimoiy soha va
iqtisodiyot tarmoqlarini rivojlantirish masalasiga davlatimiz tomonidan alohida e’tibor
qaratilmoqda.[11] Xususan, pedagogik yo‘nalishlarda kadrlar tayyorlash sifatiga e'tiborni
kuchaytirish, pedagogik ta'lim yo‘nalishlari va mutaxassisliklari bo‘yicha o‘quv reja va
dasturlarini ilg‘or xorijiy tajriba asosida qayta ko‘rib chiqish va takomillashtirish, pedagogik
yo‘nalishda tahsil olayotgan talabalarda ta'lim jarayonida innovatsion ta’lim vositalaridan
foydalanish, pedagogik texnologiyalarning zamonaviy usullarini qo‘llash ko‘nikmalarini
shakllantirish, pedagogik ta'lim infratuzilmasining samaradorligini oshirishga erishish bilan
bog‘liq masalalar yechimini kutmoqda.
Bo‘lajak mutaxassislar mobilligi psixologik mexanizm eksteriorizatsiya va intererizatsiya
jarayonida madaniyatni rivojlantirish va o‘zlashtirishning shaxs ichidagi mexanizmi bo‘lsa va
nafaqat psixologik, balki ijtimoiy-psixologik mexanizmlarni talabaning kasbiy mobilligi
jamiyat bilan o‘zaro munosabatlarining o‘ziga xos xususiyatlarini ochib bersa, ijtimoiymadaniy makon ta'lim maydoniga aylantirilganda u pedagogik mexanizm sharoitlarni aks
ettiradi. Bu mexanizmlarning bir-biri bilan bog'liq bo'lib, o'zaro bog'liqlik va bir-birini
to'ldirish tamoyillari asosida natijani ta’minlaydi.

Oliy o‘quv yurtlarida bo‘lajak mutaxassisning kasbiy mobilligini rivojlantirish uchun
ma'lum shart-sharoitlarni yaratib, uning jamiyat bilan aloqasini tashkil qilinganda inson
"jamiyatdan faqat o‘zi tayyor bo‘lgan narsani olishi" mumkinligini hisobga olsak, natijaviylik
yuqori darajaga chiqishi qiyin.
Yaratilgan shart-sharoitlar ish berishi uchun avvalo talabalarda mobil mutaxassis sifatida
shakllanishi uchun psixologik mexanizmlar qanchalik rivojlanganligi muhim rol o‘ynaydi.
Mazkur fikr oliy ta’lim muassasasida talabalarni mobil mutaxassis etib shakllantirishning asosiy
mexanizmi faqat ular uchun yaratiladigan shart-sharoit emas balki, talabaning madaniy va
shaxsiy identifikatsiya mexanizmi bo‘lib, yaratiladigan shart-sharoitning ishlashi ma’lum
darajada ta’minlanadi hamda talabada mobil mutaxassisga xos fazilatlarni shakllantirish va
rivojlantirish uchun sharoit yaratishga asos bo‘lgan shaxsiy mexanizmlar va pedagogik
mexanizmlar o‘zining natijasini bera oladi.
Mavzuga oid adabiyotlarning tahlili. Oliy ta'limda mobil mutaxassislarni shakllantirish
xususida G.M.Kazakova umumiy shaklda madaniy muhit bilan shaxsiy identifikatsiya
bog‘liqligini tadqiq etib, unda o‘zgargan muhitni talaba tomonidan ichki qabul qilish, bir muhit
bilan boshqa muhitni identifikatsiyalash tushunilishi kerakligini ta'kidlaydi. G.M.Kazakova
fikricha, bunda talaba o‘ziga va boshqalarga ma'lum bir tasvir namunasini "sinab ko‘rish"
amalga oshadi [4].
Tahlil va natijalar. Ta'kidlanishicha, madaniy va shaxsiy identifikatsiya mexanizmi
talabaning intellektual va axloqiy tajribasini shakllantirishni ta'minlaydigan atrof-muhitga
rezonansli javob sifatida qaralib, madaniy va shaxsiy identifikatsiyaning "bog‘liqligi" - bu
ta'limiy vaziyat bilan sub'ekt yetarli tajribaga yega bo‘lmagan muammoga duch kelgan vaziyat
bo‘lib, bunday holda, muammoning o‘zi yemas, balki zarur bilim, ko‘nikma va harakat
usullarini yegallash uning asosiy vazifasiga aylanishi mumkin.
Darhaqiqat, oliy ta’limda ta'lim holati har doim muammoli bo‘lib, talabadan unga atrofida
nima bo‘layotgani haqida doimo mulohaza yuritishni talab qiladi va bu holat ba'zi talabalar
uchun haqiqiy ta'lim sharoitiga aylanishi mumkin, ammo boshqalar uchun yemas, shuning
uchun oliy ta’limda ta’lim muhiti va shart-sharoitlarini talabalarning hayotiy faoliyatini tashkil
yetishda avvalo shaxsga yo‘naltirilgan yondashuv g‘oyalariga asoslanishi maqsadga muvofiq
[1].
Oliy ta’lim muassasasida bo‘lajak mutaxassisning kasbiy mobilligini shakllantirish va
rivojlantirishning ijtimoiy-madaniy makonini modellashtirish kelajakdagi mutaxassisning
hayotini mazmun va yo‘nalish jihatidan pedagogik ahamiyatga yega, yorqin voqealar bilan
to‘ldirishga asoslangan ya’ni yaratilgan shart-shatoitlarni anglash va ular bilan hamkorlik
o‘rnatishni taqazo etadi va aynan shu narsa talaba ta'lim makonining bir qismini ifodalaydi [7].
Oliy ta’lim muassasasida har bir talaba uchun turli hodisalarning ahamiyati turlicha bo‘lganligi
tufayli, talabalarning individual ta'lim maydoni haqida ham o‘ylash lozim.
Talabaning uning o‘quv faoliyatida nimalar sodir bo‘layotgani bilan tanishishi ta'lim
makoniga pedagogik ta'sir ko‘rsatishning asosiy sharti hosoblanadi.

Xulosa qilib aytganda, oliy ta’limda ta’lim samaradorligi ta'lim muhiti va talabalarning
munosabati bilan uyg‘unlbgiga bevosita bog‘liq, shunga ko‘ra, innovatsion ta’lim muhitini
ijtimoiy-madaniy muhitga, xuddi shunday ijtimoiy-madaniy muhit ta'lim muhitini, innovatsion
ta’lim muhiti bilan yoki, alohida bir hodisani jarayonga o‘tkazishni ta'minlaydigan psixologik
va pedagogik mexanizmlarni amalga oshirish zarur bo‘ladi. Eng muhimi esa, bo‘lajak
mutaxassisning kasbiy kompitensiyalarini va albatta, ularning individual rivojlantirish
mexanizmlarini zamona talabiga muvofiq tashkil etish va ta’lmi mazmuniga singdirish lozim.

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

analyzed using the SPSS program. The results indicated a statistically significant negative
correlation between rigidity and perfectionism factors with impostor syndrome. Meanwhile,
comparison and fear of negative evaluation were found to have no significant relationship with
the syndrome.
Keywords: impostor syndrome, rigidity, perfectionism, comparison, fear of negative
evaluation, psychological analysis.
Kirish
Imposter sindromi – bu inson o‘z yutuqlarini o‘zining ichki mehnati, salohiyati va
bilimlari mahsuli sifatida emas, balki tashqi omillar, omad yoki tasodif natijasi sifatida qabul
qiladigan murakkab psixologik holatdir (Clance & Imes, 1978). Bu holatda shaxs ichki ravishda
o‘zini “soxta”, “haqiqiy emas” deb his qiladi va bir kuni atrofdagilar uning asl qobiliyatsizligini
fosh qilishi mumkin degan doimiy yashirin xavotirni boshdan kechiradi. Tadqiqotlar shuni
ko‘rsatadiki, imposter sindromi nafaqat shaxsiy o‘ziga ishonchni pasaytiradi, balki professional
faoliyatda ham motivatsiyani susaytirib, stress va depressiya darajalarini oshiradi (Sakulku &
Alexander, 2011). Ushbu sindrom ayniqsa yuqori salohiyatli, akademik va professional
sohalarda faoliyat yuritayotgan shaxslar orasida keng tarqalgan. Tadqiqotlarga ko‘ra,
doktorantura talabalari, yosh olimlar va yuqori lavozimdagi mutaxassislar imposter sindromiga
ko‘proq moyil bo‘ladi (Parkman, 2016).
Imposter sindromining shakllanishiga ta’sir qiluvchi asosiy omillar orasida oilaviy
tarbiya, ijtimoiy bosim, perfeksionizm va shaxsiy psixologik xususiyatlar muhim o‘rin tutadi
(Langford & Clance, 1993). Masalan, bolalikda faqat yuqori natijalar uchun maqtov olish,
shaxsga doimiy taqqoslash asosida baho berish yoki mukammallikni doimiy kutish kabi
tarbiyaviy usullar insonda shubha va o‘ziga ishonchsizlik hissining ildiz otishiga sabab bo‘lishi
mumkin.
Bundan tashqari, jamiyatdagi mukammallik me’yorlari va ijtimoiy tarmoqlardagi
ideallashtirilgan obrazlar ham shaxsning o‘zini boshqalar bilan solishtirib, o‘z yutuqlarini
arzimas deb his qilishiga olib keladi (Vergauwe et al., 2015). Perfeksionizm — o‘z oldiga
ortiqcha talablar qo‘yish va natijalardan hech qachon qoniqmaslik — imposter sindromining
rivojlanishida asosiy ichki omillardan biri sifatida ko‘rsatilgan.
Shu sababli, ushbu tadqiqotimizning maqsadi imposter sindromining shakllanishiga ta’sir
qiluvchi omillar — rigidlik (qat’iy fikr), perfektsionizm, o‘zini boshqalar bilan taqqoslash va
salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish kabi psixologik xususiyatlar bilan imposter sindromi o‘rtasidagi
bog‘liqlikni empirik ravishda aniqlashdan iborat bo‘ldi. Tadqiqotimiz natijalari bu omillar va
imposter sindromi o‘rtasida qanday korrelyatsiya mavjudligini aniqlab, bu holatning psixologik
ildizlarini chuqurroq tushunishga yordam beradi.
Ushbu izlanish natijalari nafaqat ilmiy nazariyani boyitadi, balki amaliy psixologik
maslahat va ta’lim tizimida imposter sindromining profilaktikasiga qaratilgan aniq strategiyalar
ishlab chiqishga ham xizmat qiladi.

Metodologiya
Ushbu tadqiqotda imposter sindromining shakllanishiga ta’sir qiluvchi psixologik
omillarni aniqlash maqsadida empirik tadqiqot o‘tkazildi. Tadqiqotda Qo‘qon davlat
universitetining psixologiya yo‘nalishida tahsil olayotgan 4-kurs talabalaridan iborat 64
nafar respondent ishtirok etdi. Respondentlar ixtiyoriylik va anonimlik tamoyillariga
asoslangan holda jalb qilindi. Ishtirokchilar tadqiqot maqsadi va shartlari haqida oldindan
xabardor qilindi va roziliklari olindi.
Ma’lumot to‘plash uchun bir nechta psixologik o‘lchov vositalaridan foydalanildi.
Rigidlik testi shaxslarning qat’iy fikrlash va moslashuvchanlik darajasini baholash uchun,
perfektsionizm testi esa talabalarning o‘zlariga va atrofdagilarga nisbatan mukammallik
talablari darajasini aniqlash uchun qo‘llanildi. Taqqoslash testi yordamida respondentlarning
o‘zlarini boshqalar bilan qanchalik tez-tez taqqoslash odati o‘rganildi. Salbiy baholanishdan
qo‘rqish testi ijtimoiy baholardan yoki tanqiddan qo‘rqish darajasini baholashga xizmat qildi.
Imposter sindromi testi esa respondentlarning o‘z yutuqlarini tasodifga bog‘lash, o‘zini “soxta”
sifatida his qilish darajalarini aniqlash uchun maxsus validatsiyadan o‘tgan o‘lchovlar asosida
tuzildi.
Barcha testlar yozma shaklda topshirildi va o‘z-o‘zini baholash asosida to‘ldirildi.
Ma’lumotlar SPSS 26.0 statistik dasturi yordamida tahlil qilindi. Ma’lumotlarning normal
taqsimlanganlik darajasini aniqlash uchun Shapiro-Wilk testi o‘tkazildi. Ushbu test kichik
hajmdagi tanlovlar uchun eng mos va ishonchli hisoblanadi. Omillar o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlikni
aniqlash maqsadida Pearson korrelyatsiya koeffitsienti hisoblandi. Pearson testi normal
taqsimlangan ma’lumotlar uchun tanlangan bo‘lib, o‘zgaruvchilar orasidagi chiziqli
bog‘liqlikni aniqlash imkonini beradi. Statistik tahlilda p-qiymati 0.05 dan kichik bo‘lsa,
natijalar ishtatistik ahamiyatli deb baholandi.
Tadqiqotning ayrim cheklovlari mavjud. Xususan, respondentlarning faqat 4-kurs
talabalaridan iborat bo‘lgani natijalarning umumlashuvchanligini cheklaydi. Shuningdek,
ma’lumotlar o‘z-o‘zini baholash usuli asosida yig‘ilganligi sababli javoblarda subyektivlik va
ijtimoiy maqbullik effektlari ehtimoli mavjud. Tadqiqot kesim shaklida (cross-sectional)
o‘tkazilgan bo‘lib, sabab-oqibat munosabatlarini to‘liq aniqlash imkoniyatini bermaydi.
Biroq, bu tadqiqot imposter sindromiga ta’sir qiluvchi psixologik omillarni aniqlash va
ularning o‘zaro munosabatlarini tahlil qilishda muhim dastlabki qadam bo‘lib xizmat qildi va
kelgusida kengroq va chuqurroq tadqiqotlar o‘tkazish uchun asos yaratdi.

Normality testi natijalariga ko‘ra barcha o‘zgaruvchilar bo‘yicha Shapiro-Wilk
statistikasi p-qiymati 0.05 dan kichik chiqdi (Rigidlik – 0.00001, Perfektsionizm – 0.00019,
Taqqoslash – 0.00000, Salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish – 0.02210, Imposter sindromi – 0.00115).
Bu natija statistik jihatdan ma’lumotlarning normal taqsimlanmaganligini anglatadi. Boshqacha
qilib aytganda, respondentlarning rigidlik, perfektsionizm, taqqoslash, salbiy baholanishdan
qo‘rqish va imposter sindromi darajalari jamiyatda odatdagi gumbazsimon taqsimot
ko‘rinishida emas, balki notekis va o‘zgaruvchan shaklda tarqalgan.
Psixologik jihatdan bu holat shuni ko‘rsatadiki, respondentlar o‘rtasida shaxsiy
psixologik xususiyatlarda katta individual farqlar mavjud. Rigidlik, perfektsionizm kabi
ko‘rsatkichlar bir qator talabalar orasida juda yuqori darajada namoyon bo‘lgani holda,
boshqalarda esa bunday xususiyatlar sezilarli darajada past darajada ifodalangan. Natijada,
tadqiqot ishtirokchilari psixologik portreti jihatidan heterojen (turlicha) guruhni tashkil etadi.
Bunday noan’anaviy taqsimot shaxsiy psixologik o‘zgaruvchanlikni aks ettiradi.
Talabalarning rigidlik darajasi, mukammallikka intilish ko‘lami va imposter sindromini
boshdan kechirish darajalari shaxsiy tajriba, tarbiya, ijtimoiy muhit va individual shaxs
xususiyatlari bilan bog‘liq holda shakllangan. Xususan, ba’zi talabalar ichki mustahkamlik va
qat’iyatlilik tufayli imposter sindromini kamroq his qilishgan bo‘lsa, boshqalar yuqori
darajadagi perfektsionistik talablar va ijtimoiy taqqoslash sababli o‘z salohiyatiga nisbatan
shubha bilan qaragan.
Shu bilan birga, normal taqsimlanmaslik respondentlar guruhining psixologik ehtiyojlari
ham turlicha ekanligini ko‘rsatadi. Ayrim talabalar uchun moslashuvchanlikni rivojlantirish,
boshqalar uchun esa o‘z mehnatini qadrlash va o‘z-o‘zini tasdiqlash mexanizmlarini
kuchaytirish zarur. Bu esa psixologik yordam va rivojlantirish dasturlarini ishlab chiqishda
individual yondashuvni talab qiladi.
Umuman olganda, ushbu normality testi natijalari imposter sindromi va unga ta’sir
qiluvchi psixologik omillar har bir shaxsda noyob tarzda shakllanib, rivojlanishini ko‘rsatadi.
Bu esa tadqiqotda olingan natijalarni talqin qilishda ehtiyotkorlik va har bir individning ichki
tajribasini hisobga olish zarurligini ta’kidlaydi.

Korrelyatsiya tahlili natijalariga ko‘ra, rigidlik va imposter sindromi o‘rtasida ishtatistik
ahamiyatli salbiy bog‘liqlik aniqlangan (r = -0.450, p = 0.00982). Bu natija shuni ko‘rsatadiki,
qat’iy fikrli va prinsipial shaxslar imposter sindromini kamroq his qilishadi. Ular o‘z
pozitsiyalariga ishonchli bo‘lib, tashqi baholarga kamroq bog‘liq bo‘lganliklari sababli o‘z
yutuqlarini tasodif yoki omad natijasi sifatida qabul qilish ehtimoli past bo‘ladi.
Perfektsionizm va imposter sindromi o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik ham salbiy va ishtatistik
ahamiyatli bo‘lib chiqqan (r = -0.448, p = 0.01022). Ushbu natija odatdagi taxminlardan farq
qiladi, chunki ko‘plab tadqiqotlarda yuqori perfektsionizm imposter sindromining kuchayishi
bilan bog‘liq deb qaraladi. Ammo, mazkur tadqiqotda sog‘lom perfektsionistik tendensiyalar
— o‘z mehnatini qadrlash, yuqori sifatga intilish, lekin o‘zini keskin tanqid qilmaslik —
respondentlarda imposterlik hissini kamaytirishga xizmat qilgan bo‘lishi mumkin. Bu holat,
talabalarning o‘z mehnatlari va yutuqlarini ob’ektiv baholashga va shaxsiy salohiyatlarini qabul
qilishga o‘rganganliklarini ko‘rsatadi.
Taqqoslash va imposter sindromi o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik esa kuchsiz va ishtatistik
ahamiyatga ega emas (r = 0.190, p = 0.29796). Bu natija respondentlarning o‘zlarini boshqalar
bilan taqqoslash odati mavjud bo‘lsa-da, bu holat ularning o‘z yutuqlarini rad etishiga yoki
o‘zlarini “soxta” sifatida his qilishiga sezilarli ta’sir ko‘rsatmayotganini anglatadi. Demak,
taqqoslash ehtiyoji mavjud bo‘lsa ham, bu respondentlarning ichki o‘z-o‘zini qadrlash tizimiga
kuchli salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatmagan.
Salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish va imposter sindromi o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik deyarli mavjud
emas (r = 0.007, p = 0.96802). P-qiymatning juda katta bo‘lishi ushbu ikki o‘zgaruvchi o‘rtasida
hech qanday mustahkam munosabat yo‘qligini ko‘rsatadi. Bu esa respondentlarning ijtimoiy
bahodan yoki salbiy fikrdan qo‘rqishi imposter sindromining rivojlanishiga sezilarli ta’sir
ko‘rsatmayotganligini anglatadi. Shuningdek, bu natija talabalar ichki motivatsiyaga va o‘zo‘zini baholash qobiliyatiga ko‘proq tayanayotganliklarini ko‘rsatadi.
Umuman olganda, rigidlik va perfektsionizmning imposter sindromi bilan salbiy
bog‘liqligi respondentlarning mustahkam ichki pozitsiyalari va mehnatga asoslangan o‘z-o‘zini
qadrlash tizimi rivojlanganligini ko‘rsatadi. Taqqoslash va salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish esa
ushbu sindromda hal qiluvchi rol o‘ynamaydi, bu esa respondentlarning ijtimoiy ta’sirlarga
nisbatan nisbatan barqaror psixologik holatda ekanligini anglatadi.
Muhokama
Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, rigid fikrlovchi shaxslar o‘z pozitsiyalariga
mustahkam tayanadilar va tashqi baholarga kamroq ehtiyoj sezadilar, natijada ular imposter
sindromi belgilari va o‘z qobiliyatlariga shubha bilan qarash holatlarini kamroq boshdan
kechiradilar. Bu xulosani Clance va Imes (1978) tomonidan olib borilgan dastlabki tadqiqotlar
131

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

ham qo‘llab-quvvatlaydi, ularning fikriga ko‘ra, ichki mustahkamlik va o‘z-o‘zini qadrlash
darajasi yuqori bo‘lgan shaxslar imposterlik hissidan nisbatan kamroq aziyat chekadi. Bizning
tadqiqotimizda rigidlik va imposter sindromi o‘rtasida ishtatistik ahamiyatli salbiy bog‘liqlik (r
= -0.450, p < 0.01) aniqlangani ham bu fikrni tasdiqlaydi.
Perfektsionistik shaxslar esa o‘z mehnat natijalarini yuqori baholashga va yutuqlarini
tasodifga emas, o‘z qobiliyat va sa’y-harakatlariga bog‘lashga moyil bo‘ladilar. Bu natija
Sakulku va Alexander (2011) tadqiqotlari bilan hamohang bo‘lib, sog‘lom perfektsionizm
insonda ichki motivatsiyani oshirishi va o‘z yutuqlariga nisbatan ob’ektiv qarashni
rivojlantirishi mumkinligini ko‘rsatadi. Bizning tadqiqotda perfektsionizm va imposter
sindromi o‘rtasida salbiy va ishtatistik ahamiyatli bog‘liqlik (r = -0.448, p < 0.01) aniqlangani,
talabalar orasida mukammallikka intilishning ijobiy yo‘nalishda shakllanganligini anglatadi. Bu
holat respondentlarning mehnatga asoslangan o‘z-o‘zini qadrlash darajasi yuqoriligi va ularning
imposter sindromiga nisbatan nisbatan kamroq sezgirligini ko‘rsatadi.
Taqqoslash va salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish ko‘rsatkichlari esa imposter sindromi bilan
ishtatistik ahamiyatli bog‘liqlik ko‘rsatmadi. Taqqoslash (r = 0.190, p = 0.29796) va salbiy
baholanishdan qo‘rqish (r = 0.007, p = 0.96802) o‘rtasidagi bog‘lanishning zaifligi shuni
ko‘rsatadiki, respondentlar o‘zlarini boshqalar bilan solishtirishlari va ijtimoiy bahodan
qo‘rqishlariga qaramay, bu omillar ular o‘z yutuqlarini qabul qilish yoki rad etish qarorlariga
sezilarli ta’sir ko‘rsatmaydi. Bu natija Vergauwe va hamkorlari (2015) tomonidan olib borilgan
tadqiqotlar bilan mos keladi. Ularning tadqiqotlari ham imposter sindromining shakllanishida
tashqi omillarga nisbatan ichki omillar (o‘z-o‘zini baholash va o‘z qadriga yetish) kuchliroq rol
o‘ynashini ko‘rsatgan edi.
Shuningdek,
ushbu
tadqiqot
respondentlar
orasida
shaxsiy psixologik
o‘zgaruvchanlikning yuqoriligi va shaxsiy ehtiyojlarning farqliligini ham namoyon etdi.
Normality test natijalarida barcha o‘zgaruvchilar normal taqsimlanmaganligi aniqlangani (p <
0.05) talabalar orasida shaxsiy psixologik xususiyatlarning turlicha shakllanganligini
ko‘rsatadi. Bu esa imposter sindromi va unga ta’sir qiluvchi omillar har bir shaxsda individual
tarzda shakllanishini tasdiqlaydi va psixologik yordam hamda rivojlanish dasturlarida
individual yondashuv zarurligini ta’kidlaydi.
Xulosa
Ushbu tadqiqot natijalari imposter sindromi shakllanishida individual psixologik omillar
hal qiluvchi rol o‘ynashini tasdiqladi. O‘rganilgan indikatorlar – rigidlik, perfektsionizm,
taqqoslash va salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish – orasida aynan rigidlik va perfektsionizm imposter
sindromi bilan salbiy va ishtatistik ahamiyatli bog‘liqlik ko‘rsatdi. Bu shuni anglatadiki, qat’iy
fikrli va sog‘lom perfektsionistik talablarga ega shaxslar o‘z yutuqlarini ob’ektiv baholashga,
ularni tasodifga emas, mehnat va salohiyat natijasiga bog‘lashga ko‘proq moyil bo‘ladilar va
shu sababli imposter sindromidan kamroq aziyat chekadilar.
Taqqoslash va salbiy baholanishdan qo‘rqish esa imposter sindromi bilan kuchli bog‘liq
bo‘lmagan, bu esa respondentlar ichki baholash tizimi va shaxsiy qadriyatlarga asoslangan
132

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

fikrlash uslubini saqlab qolayotganliklarini ko‘rsatadi. Ushbu natija psixologik jihatdan juda
muhim, chunki ichki mustaqil qadrlash va o‘z-o‘zini qabul qilish shaxsning professional va
shaxsiy rivojlanishida asosiy himoya omili bo‘lib xizmat qiladi.
Normality test natijalarining normal taqsimlanmaganligi respondentlar o‘rtasida shaxsiy
xususiyatlarning keng o‘zgaruvchanligini aks ettirdi. Bu holat imposter sindromining
shakllanishida yagona universal mexanizm yo‘qligini va har bir individ uchun individual
rivojlanish yo‘li mavjudligini anglatadi. Shu bois, imposter sindromini aniqlash va unga qarshi
kurashishda individual yondashuv muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi.
Mazkur tadqiqot natijalari psixologik maslahat va profilaktik dasturlarni ishlab chiqishda
rigidlik va sog‘lom perfektsionizm xususiyatlarini rivojlantirish, ichki o‘z-o‘zini baholash
tizimini mustahkamlash va tashqi baholarga haddan tashqari bog‘liqlikni kamaytirish
zarurligini ko‘rsatdi. Shuningdek, talabalarda ichki motivatsiyani qo‘llab-quvvatlovchi va o‘z
yutuqlarini qadrlashni rag‘batlantiruvchi dasturlar orqali imposter sindromi xavfini kamaytirish
mumkinligi aniqlab berildi.
Umuman olganda, ushbu tadqiqot imposter sindromining shakllanishiga ta’sir etuvchi
omillarni aniqlashda muhim nazariy va amaliy asos yaratdi va kelgusida yanada kengroq, yosh,
jins va ijtimoiy guruhlar kesimida solishtirma tadqiqotlar olib borish zarurligini ko‘rsatdi.

Kirish. Oilaviy munosabatlarni o‘rganish qadimdan o‘rganiladigan sohalardan biri
bo‘lib, xozirgi kunda ham muhim sohalardan biridir.O‘zbekiston Respublikasi 2018- yil 27iyundagi PF-5466- son ««Yoshlar – kelajagimiz» «Davlat dasturini tasdiqlash to‘g‘risida»
prezidentimizning farmonining 1-bandida “Zamonaviy bilim va ko‘nikmalarga ega,
mamlakatning munosib kelajagi uchun javobgarlikni o‘z zimmasiga ola biladigan barkamol,
maqsadga intiluvchan va serg‘ayrat yoshlarni tarbiyalash mamlakatni barqaror va ildam
rivojlantirishning eng muhim shartidir”[1] belgilab o‘tilgan bo‘lib darhaqiqat bugungi kunda
yosh avlod tarbiyasiga e’tibor davlatimiz tomonidan alohida yuksak tashabbuslardan biri

sifatida tadbiq etilmoqda. Ushbu farmonning amaldagi faoliayati asosida mamalakatimiz
bo‘ylab xar bir oilaga alohida moddiy va ma’naviy rivojlanishlari uchun imkoniyatlar
yaratilmoqda.
Bunga misol qilib, prezidentimiz Shavkat Mirziyoyev Miromonovichning
“Har bir oila-tadbirkor” dasturini amalga oshirish to‘g‘risi 2018-yil 7-iyundagi PQ3777-son qarorining 6-bandida “har bir oila va xonadonlarni xatlov asosida qamrab olgan
holda tadbirkorlik bilan shug‘ullanish salohiyati, istak va takliflarni sinchkovlik bilan
o‘rganish; o‘rganish davomida oilalarning tadbirkorlik g‘oyasi va ko‘nikmasi, ushbu faoliyatni
amalga oshirish uchun yetarli sharoitlari mavjudligini aniqlash;”[2] ko‘zda tutilgan bo‘lib,
ushbu tashabbuslar asosida xar bir oiladagi ijtimoiy sharoitni yaxshilash hamda, islohatlar
asosida oiladagi bola shaxsini shakillanishi uchun imkoniyatlarni yaratishdan iboratdir.
Binobarin, aytishimiz mumkinki, bola shaxsi shakillanishining asosini oila tashkil etadi,
oilaning moddiy va ma’naviy rivojini ta’minlash esa albatta davlatimizda siyosat darajasiga
ko‘tarilgan va bu kabi islohatlarni yuqorida ko‘rsatilgan davlat dasturlarida isbotini topmoqda.
Bola shaxsini rivojlanishida oiladagi muhitning muhimlik darajasi katta xisoblanadi.
Dunyo paydo bo‘libdiki, bola tarbiyasiga e’tibor o‘z kuchini yo‘qotmagan, bolalar tarbiyasida
oilaning roli va oila azolarining o‘zaro hamkorligi, uch avlodning ijtimoiy munosabatlarining
eng muhim jihatlari oilaviy ijtimioy munosabatlarning mexanizmlari, turli xulq-atvor
ko‘rinishlari oilalardagi o‘zaro munosabatlar, tarbiyaviy namuna usullarinng tashkil qilinganligi
borasida bir qancha tadqiqotlar almaga oshirilib kelinmoqda.
Tadqiqotning maqsadi: Avlodlararo munosabatlarni bola shaxsini shakillanishga
qaratilgan xorij olimlarining fikrlarini tahlil qilish.
Tadqiqot vazifalari:
- bola shaxsini shakillanishida avlodlararo munosabatlar bo‘yicha xorij olimlarining
fikrlarini o‘rganish.
Mavzuga oid adabiyotlarning taxlili: (Literature review) Bu soxada qadimdan oilada
bola shaxsi rivojiga ta‘sir etuvchi avlodaro munosabatlarning ijtimoiy -psixologik xususiyatlari
o‘rganilib kelinmoqda:
Jumladan, Platonning avlodlar va ularning insoniyat tamaddunining taraqqiyotidagi roli
haqidagi g‘oyalarini tushunish uchun, fikrimizcha, uning inson va davlat tipologiyasiga oid
qarashlariga murojaat etish zarur.
Platonning fikricha, ularning birligi va o‘zaro aloqadorligi ilm sohasida tayanch bo‘lib,
barcha ijtimoiy jarayonlarni belgilaydi. Ruh tiplaridan Platon avval davlat tiplarini chiqaradi,
ulardan kelib chiqib esa inson tipologiyasini belgilaydi va uning beshta tipini farqlaydi. Mazkur
mantiqni u alohida shaxslardan ko‘ra davlatda “feʼllar nisbatan aniqroq”[3] ekanligi haqidagi
fikr bilan asoslaydi, shuning uchun uning mulohazalarida inson tiplari va davlat tiplari haqidagi
fikrlar bir-birini o‘zaro to‘ldirib keladi.
Inson va davlat tiplari dinamikasini Platon ruh strukturasidagi mutanosiblikning
o‘zgarishi bilan bog‘laydi. Shunday bo‘lsada, Platon taʼlimotida davlat ham, individuum ham
136

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

emas, ayni nasliy odam asos vazifasini o‘taydi. Bunday tushuncha uning oila ichidagi avlodlar
amashinuvini tahlilidan kelib chiqadi. G.А. Kondratova fikriga qo‘shilgan holda faraz qilish
mumkinki, uning besh inson tipining dialektik birligi bitta nasliy davrni, yaʼni nasliy birlikni
tashkil etadi. “Shu asosda insonning shajaraviy birligiga o‘rta bo‘g‘in sifatida qarash mumkinki,
u orqali inson va jamiyat o‘zaro bir-biriga taʼsir qiladi yoki, boshqa so‘zlar bilan aytganda,
individual va jamoaviy ifodadagi urug‘ yashash modusini tashkil etgan bir butun insonda
namoyon bo‘ladi”[4].
Shajaraviy davrni, uning inson besh tipi tizimi ko‘rinishidagi antropologik strukturasini
ajratish Platonga sotsial dinamikadagi obʼektivlik va subʼektivlik dialektikasini uzviy ko‘rsatish
imkoniyatini berdi. Аyni shajaraviy davr insonning vorisiylik va rivojlanish bilan bog‘liq
hayotining vaqtga oid, tarixiy aspektlarini tavsiflaydi.
Insonning besh tipi tizimida Platon filogenezning o‘ziga xos sotsio-madaniy birligini,
mazkur shajaraning sotsio-madaniy tajribasini o‘zida jamlagan sulola so‘zining davom
ettiruvchisini ko‘rsatgan. Xudo “otalar gunohi uchun.. ularning bolalarini, va bolalarining
bolalarini va shunday qilib uchinchi, to‘rtinchi bo‘g‘inigacha jazolaydi”[5], deb behuda
aytilmagan, yaʼni u insonni hayotining individual modusida emas, sulolaviy modusida
jazolaydi, juda bo‘lmaganda meva bermaydigan shox sifatida butun shajarasini “qirqadi”. O‘z
holicha Shajaraviy yaxlitlik -inson va jamiyat o‘rtasidagi asosiy, bog‘lovchi bo‘g‘in, chunki u
o‘zida insonning individual va jamoaviy hayotining ajralmasbirligini ifodalaydi.
Shuningdek, Platon taʼkidlaydiki, inson evolyutsiyasining sifatiy jihatlari tipologik
farqlar sifatida alohida inson hayotida sulola avlodlaridagidan ko‘ra kamroq namoyon bo‘lgan.
Yangi Yevropa falsafasida sulolaviy odam fenomeni haqida G. Gegelьyozgan. U sulolaga
insonga moslagan holda “subʼekting yagonaligi bilan o‘z ichida mavjud oddiy birlik” sifatida
qaraganki, “u bunda o‘z konkret substantsiyasiga ega, ammo hali yagona subʼektga
aylanmagan”[6]. S. Kьerkegor insonning tarixiylik xususiyatiga eʼtiborni qaratgan va bu
xususiyatni sulola hayoti bilan bog‘lagan, chunki “har bir daqiqada munosabatlar shunday
o‘rnatiladiki, individ bir paytning o‘zida ham o‘zi ham sulola bo‘ladi”[7]
Аsosiy vazifa insonni, u orqali esa butun sulolani takomillashtirishdan iborat, shuning
uchun individning suloladan ajralishi darhol sulolani o‘zgacha qiladi. P.Sorokin insonning
sulolaviy xususiyatlarini “sotsial-sixologik hodisalarning asosiy qonuniyatlari” bilan
bog‘lagan[8].
Аvlodlararo munosabatlar muammosining tarixiy aspektini faylasuflar M. Xaydegger va
U. Gusserl o‘rganishgan. Ularning asarlarida biz avlodlar o‘rtasidagi tarixiy aloqalar
to‘g‘risidagi g‘oyaning davomini kuzatamiz. Shu yo‘nalishda T.V. Shittsova o‘tkazgan tadqiqot
ishidagi tahlil ham diqqatni jalb etadi. Muallif eski va yangi avlodlar o‘rtasidagi, kattalar va
bolalar o‘rtasidagi yoki generativ munosabatlar singari intersubʼektiv tajribaning konkret
shakllarini tahlil etadi. Tadqiqotchi genertiv aloqa inson hayotining tarixiyligi sifatida faqat
diaxronik perspektivasi mavzusi bilan bog‘langan fenomenologik taʼlimotlarga murojaat etadi.
Bular Ye. Gusserlning tarixning transtsendental kontseptsiyasi va M. Xaydeggerning

ekzistentsial tahlili. Yashash dunyosi sotsial-tarixiy genezisining transtsendental asoslanishini
tasdiqlash uchun Ye.Gusserl markaziy tushuncha sifatida generativlik tushunchasini oladi.
Mazkur tushuncha insoniyat olamidagi avlodlarning biologik almashinuvi bilan konkret
hamjamiyat hayotidagi madaniy jihatdan muhim maʼnolarning tiklanishi va yangilanishining
tarixiy jarayoni o‘rtasidagi mufassal aloqani o‘rnatadi. “O‘z” hayotiy dunyosining (Heimwelt)
tarixiy shakllanishini transtsendental asoslash muammosiga murojaat etib, Ye. Gusserl birbiridan tug‘ilish va o‘lish vositasida ajratiladigan avlodlarning faqat bir birini almashtirib
kelgan holatlarda tinimsiz maʼnoni aniqlab borilishi eksplikatsiyalash zaruratiga to‘qnash
keladi. Shunga muvofiq, uning o‘ylab qo‘ygan tahlili alohida, regressiv yondoshuvni talab
etadi: «Tegishli hamjamiyatning shakllanishini generativ maʼnoda orqaga kuzatish zarur,-deydi Ye. Gusserl, - dunyoda shaklantirilgan tarkibni generativ kuzatish va shunga muvofiq uni
tarixiy anʼanalarning birligi bilan xarakterlanadigan bir-birining ketidan keladigan avlodlarning
hayotiy dunyosi sifatida, yaʼni tarixiy madaniy olam sifatida anglash kerak...”[9].
Tadqiqot metodologiyasi: (Research Methodology)
Nemis faylasufi qayta-qayta taʼkidlaydiki, hayvonot olamidan farqli o‘laroq, insoniyat
olamida har qanday yangi avlod o‘ziga meros qolgan madaniy dunyoni shunchaki tiklab
qolmay, o‘z madaniy ijodkorligi doirasida uni rivojlantiradi. O‘z olamini (Heimwelt) va begona
olamni (Fremdwelt) farqlar ekan, nemis faylasufi har biri o‘z shaxsiy uslubiga va o‘z shaxsiy
tipik xususiyatlariga ega bo‘lgan ikki generativ olam yoki ikki madaniy anʼana haqida gap olib
boradi. Shunday qilib, Ye.Gusserl bo‘yicha, “o‘z olami”ning sotsio-tarixiy shakllanishi asosida
ikki sathdagi intersubʼektiv strukturalar turadi: birinchidan, “o‘z olami” va “begona olam”ni
sinxronik farqlash (o‘zaro belgilash) va, ikkinchidan, avlodlarning diaxronik farqlanishi bo‘lib,
bu avlodlar o‘rtasidagi vorisiylik tegishli madaniy olamning barqarorligini taʼminlaydi. M.
Xaydegger[10], umumiy olamining tarixiy shakllanishining turli bosqichlariga mansub
individuumlar o‘rtasidagi munosabatlarni tahlil etar ekan, generativ aloqani diaxronik aspektda
ko‘rib chiqadi. Uning tahlili predmeti vazifasini aktual Dasein va “o‘lgan”, o‘tib ketgan
o‘rtasidagi hayotiy aloqalar o‘taydi. Аvlodlararo tarixiy aloqaning tilga olingan jihati bilan
chegaralanib, M. Xaydegger uni, boz ustiga,”tirik”ni “o‘lik”dan o‘ziga xos ustinligi belgilovchi
muayyan bir rakursda talqin etadi. M. Xaydegger bo‘yicha, uzilish tarixiy olamning chinakam
yangilanishining ekzistentsional sharti vazifasini o‘taydi, biroq avlodlararo aloqaning o‘zi
o‘tmish, bugun va kelajak o‘rtasidagi tarixiy (germenevtik) dialog imkoniyatini tushunishga
imkon bermaydigan bir yoqlama talqin topadi. “O‘limga kirishish” asosida tushunilgan Dasein
tarixiylik immanent, o‘z doirasida yopiq bo‘lgan individual mavjudlik sifatida namoyon
bo‘ladiki, unda tarix qayta boshlanadi va tugaydi. Mazkur qoidalar bizga avlodlarning uzilishi
to‘g‘risidagi g‘oyani qanday tushunish kerakligini belgilashda yordam beradi. Tadqiqotimizda
biz Ye. Gusserlning dunyo konstitutsiyasi (tuzilishi) ulg‘ayib borayotgan va ulg‘aygan
odamlarning intersubʼektivligi ishi ekanligi haqidagi tezisiga suyanamiz. Ulg‘aygan odam va
bola o‘rtasidagi farq dunyo konstitutsiyasi (tuzilishi) uchun tub ahamiyatga ega va birinchi

navbatda “o‘z” madaniy olamining tipikligini ifodalovchi normallik tushunchalari va
tamoyillarining asosiy tizimlari doirasida aniqlanishi mumkin.
Tarixiy hamjamiyatning «subʼekti» sifatida bola “normal katta yoshli odam”dan shunisi
bilan farqlanadiki, uning eng yaqin hayotiy vazifasini atrof dunyoning amaliy chegaralarini
o‘zlashtirish tashkil etadi. Shu tariqa, “o‘z olami”ning amaliy chegaralarida “raxna” paydo
bo‘ladi, zero to‘g‘risini aytganda, u olam faqat ota-ona uchun “o‘ziniki” bo‘ladi (belgilovchi
maʼnoli o‘zaro aloqalari vositasida bu olamni individual o‘zlashtirganlik maʼnosida), bola
uchun esa bunday o‘zlashtirish atrof dunyoni o‘ziga xos kashf etish shaklini olgan holda hali
oldinda. Shu maʼnoda, bola “normal katta yoshdagi odamlar”ning tarixan shakllangan maʼnolar
makoni sifatidagi “bizning” madaniy dunyoimizda “begonadir. Tegishli sotsio-madaniy olam
ichida ochilar ekan (tug‘ilish fakti bo‘yicha), bolaning hayotiy proektsiyasi “begona olam”ning
“tashqi ufqi”ga muvofiqdir, chunki u ham alohida bo‘shliqni tashkil etadi, yaʼni ayni tajriba
ufqining tanish, o‘zlashtirilgan maʼno-tushunchalar bilan to‘ldirilmaganligi bilan bo‘shliqdir.
“o‘z olami”ga dastlabki begonaligi tufayli bola –garchi u dunyoga maʼlum (avvaldan
belgilangan) normallik tizimining “ichida” dunyoga kelgan bo‘lsa-da, - o‘z holicha,
K.Xeydning “begona olam” chegaralarini tavsiflashiga muvofiq, “kutilmaganning yuzaga
chiqishi mintaqasi” sifatida tavsiflanishi mumkin[11]. Bola bilan maishiy hayotdagi aloqada
aniqlangan farqlar (assimetriyalar) tufayli “o‘z olami” ichida “notanishlik” doirasining tinimsiz
aktuallashuvi sodir bo‘ladiki, bu kattalarga odatiy tushunchalarga o‘rnatilmagan tushunchalar
sifatida qarash imkoniyatini beradi
Аvlodlar o‘rtasidagi o‘zgarib borayotgan munosabatlarning o‘ziga xos xususiyatini
anglashga taniqli etnograf M. Mid taklif etgan madaniyatlar tipologiyasi ham yordam beradi.
M. Mid insoniyat tarixida avlodlararo aloqalar kriteriysi bo‘yicha madaniyatning uch tipini
ajratadi: postfigurativ, bunda bolalar, avvalambor, o‘zlarining o‘tmishdoshlaridan o‘rganishadi;
kofigurativ, bunda bolalar va kattalar o‘z tenqurlaridan o‘rganishadi; prefigurativ, bunda
kattalar o‘z bolalaridan o‘rganishadi. M. Midning fikricha, sotsial va madaniy tajribani uzatish
sohasidagi avlodlararo munosabatlari evolyutsiyasi nuqtai nazaridan qaraganda madaniyat
tarixini uning uch tipining oldinma-ketin shakllanishi sifatida idrok etilishi mumkin:
postfigurativ, kofigurativ va prefigurativ.
Postfigurativ madaniyat o‘zining yagona egasi huquqlarini, yangi avlod yetuklik yoshiga
yetishi vaqtigacha – katta yoshdagi odamga taqdim etadi. Odatda mazkur vaqt anʼana yoki
qonun tomonidan belgilab beriladigan chegaraga bilan aniqlanadi. Bu holatda alohida olingan
shaxsning ham, butun sotsiumning ham hayot-faoliyatini taʼminlash uchun zarur bo‘lgan
nazariy bilim va amaliy tajriba kompleksini uzatish faqat katta avloddan nisbatan yosh avlod
tomon yo‘nalishida amalga oshiriladi. Madaniyatning mazkur tipi, chamasi, boshqalaridan
ko‘ra oldinroq vujudga kelgan; asrlar mobaynida yagona mumkin bo‘lgan deb qaralgan
madaniyatning mazkur tipi, aslini olganda uni yuzaga keltirgan shartsharoit (insonni o‘rab
turgan tabiiy va sotsial muhitning hamda uning o‘zining nisbatan o‘zgarmasligi yoki
o‘zgarishlarning nihoyatda past surʼatlari,shuningdek madaniyatning oxirgi, pirovarddagi

asoslarining anglanmaganligi va “shubhaning yo‘qligi”) kabi tarixan o‘tkinchidir. Postfigurativ
madaniyatni M. Mid o‘tmishga oid deb hisoblaydi. Shu bilan birga, uning fikricha, tilga olingan
shart-sharoitlarning ijtimoiy silsila, urush, inqiloblar davridan keyin tiklanishi hamda, odatda,
ularning ketidan paydo bo‘ladigan ko‘pchilikning turg‘unlik va barqarorlikka intilishi mazkur
madaniyat shaklining hozirgi davrda ham, yuz yillar oldindagi kabi paydo bo‘lishini mumkin
qiladi. Muayyan yoshdagi odamlar guruhi vakillarining o‘z zamondoshlari shakllantirgan xattiharakat modelini qabul qilishi madaniyatning kofigurativ usuliga o‘tishdan dalolat beradi.
Postfiguratsiyadan farqli o‘laroq, kofigurativ madaniyat tabiiy va insonning o‘zi tomonidan
yaratiladigan yashash makonining tinimsiz o‘zgarishi sharoitida shakllanadi. Bunda otaonalardan bolalarga uzatiladigan o‘tmish tajribasi yosh avlodning yangi oldindan bilish mumkin
bo‘lmagan hayoti sharoitda qisman yoki butunlay o‘z ahamiyatini yo‘qotadi. Bir paytning
o‘zida kofigurativ madaniyat o‘zida qisman postfigurativ mazmunni ham mujassam etadi. Bu,
avvalambor, bir necha avlod tomonidan tan olinadign va shuning uchun “abadiy” va “ absolyut”
deb idrok etiladigan qadriyatlar tizimiga tegishli. «Katta avlod, - yozadi M. Mid, – ezgulik,
haqiqat va go‘zallik tabiatiga oid umumiy ittifoqlik hali ham mavjud, inson tabiati uning idrok
etish, his etish, fikrlash va harakat qilishga oid tug‘ma mexanizmlari aslida o‘zgarishsiz qoladi,
deb o‘ylaydi. Bu kabi ishonch-eʼtiqodlar, tabiiyki, antropologiyadagi kashfiyotlar to‘liq anglab
yetilganida saqlanmas edi, chunki ular sotsial tartibot texnologiyalari va shakllaridagi
yangiliklar muqarrar ravishda madaniyat xarakteridagi o‘zgarishlarga olib kelishini mufassal
isbotlab bergan»[12].
Tahlil va natijalar. (Analysis аnd results)Shunday qilib, bola bilan intersubʼektiv aloqa
katta yoshdagi odamga olam identikligini va shaxsiy identikligini belgilovchi tushunchalardan
shubhalanish imkoniyatini beradi. Shunday ekan, generativ tajriba har qanday shaxslararo
uyushmaning tarixan amalga oshishi uchun birgalikda yashash asnosida (olamni) yangilash
imkoniyatini aktuallashuvi jihatidan paradigmatik ahamiyatga ega. Shu munosabat bilan,
bolaning ratsionalligini katta yoshdagilarning ratsionalligining “etilmagan” shakli hamda
keyingisining shaklanishi yo‘lidagi oraliq bosqich sifatida talqin etuvchi kontseptsiyalar tanqid
ostiga olinadi. Аksincha, amalga oshirilgan tahlil hayot olamining sotsial-tarixiy genezisi uchun
bola shaxsining transtsendental ahamiyati haqida gapirish imkoniyatini beradi. Gusserl va M.
Xaydegger g‘oyalari faylasuflarning insonning sulolaviy birligi haqidagi g‘oyalarini to‘ldiradi,
ularni avlodlararo munosabatlarni tushunishda ancha olg‘a siljishga imkon beradigan yangi
mazmun bilan boyitadi.
Xulosa va takliflar. (Conclusion/Recommendations)
Maqolamizdagi bildirilgan fikrlarga asoslangan holda, bola shaxsini shakllanishida xorij
olimlarining izlanishlarini yoritildi, avlodlararo munosabatning bola shaxsiga ta’sirini tadbiq
etish xorij olimlar nazarida tahlil etildi. Xorij olimlarining ilmiy izlanishlaridan ko‘rinib
turibdiki, avlodlararo munosabat muhimlik jihatlari beqiyos.Avlodlararo munosabatlarning
bola shaxsiga shakillanishidagi ta’sirini o‘rganish dolzarbdir.

Kirish: Pedagogik muloqot, ayniqsa verbal kommunikatsiya, ta’lim jarayonida o‘quvchi
bilan o‘qituvchi o‘rtasidagi muhim aloqani tashkil etuvchi asosiy mexanizmdir. Muloqotning
samaradorligi, uning pedagogik vazifalarni bajarishda qanday ahamiyatga ega ekanligi,
ta’limdagi muvaffaqiyatni belgilovchi omillardan biridir. Ta’lim tizimi o‘qituvchi va o‘quvchi
o‘rtasidagi interaktiv muloqotga asoslangan bo‘lib, pedagogik muvaffaqiyatning ko‘p jihatlari,
jumladan, o‘qituvchining so‘zlash uslubi, o‘quvchilarning tilni anglash qobiliyati va ularning
muloqotga bo‘lgan munosabati bilan chambarchas bog‘liqdir[1]. Verbal kommunikatsiya orqali
o‘quvchilar bilan samarali muloqot o‘rnatish, ularning shaxsiy, intellektual va emotsional
rivojlanishiga ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Shuningdek, verbal kommunikatsiyaning pedagogik
muloqotdagi roli, uning psixologik aspektlari hamda ta’lim jarayonida ijobiy o‘zgarishlarni
yuzaga keltirishdagi o‘rni ilmiy tadqiqotlar orqali o‘rganilishi zarur. Pedagogik muloqotning
asosiy tarkibiy qismi bo‘lgan verbal kommunikatsiya, o‘qituvchi va o‘quvchi o‘rtasidagi
ma’lumot almashinuvi, tajriba, hissiyot va fikrlarning o‘zaro ifodalanishini ta’minlaydi. Ta’lim
jarayonida muloqotning mazmuni, shakli va samaradorligi o‘quvchilarning o‘zlashtirish
darajasini belgilaydi[2]. O‘qituvchi va o‘quvchilar o‘rtasidagi verbal kommunikatsiyaning
sifatini oshirish, ta’lim jarayonini samarali tashkil etish uchun zarurdir. Muloqotning
samaradorligi ko‘p jihatdan o‘qituvchining kommunikativ kompetensiyasiga, uning ta’lim
jarayonida muloqotda bo‘lish va o‘quvchilarni rag‘batlantirish, ularning motivatsiyasini
oshirishdagi mahoratiga bog‘liqdir[3]. O‘qituvchining so‘zlash uslubi, tilni ishlatishdagi
aniqligi, fikrlarni lo‘nda va tushunarli bayon etish qobiliyati muloqotning samaradorligini
belgilovchi omillardan biridir. Samarali pedagogik muloqotni tashkil etish uchun psixologik
jihatlar ham muhim ahamiyatga ega. O‘quvchilarning psixologik holatini, ularning o‘quv
jarayoniga bo‘lgan munosabatini, motivatsiya darajasini va o‘ziga bo‘lgan ishonchini hisobga
olish zarur[4]. Psixologik jihatlar, o‘quvchilarning o‘zlarini qanday his qilishi va o‘zlarini ta’lim
jarayonida qanday his qilishlari ularning samarali muloqotda ishtirok etishini ta’minlaydi.

anglash, unga mos ravishda pedagogik ta’sir ko‘rsatish va o‘quvchini ilhomlantirish uning
o‘quv faoliyatiga ijobiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Bugungi kunda ta’lim tizimida o‘quvchilarning
kommunikativ kompetensiyasini rivojlantirish, ularni samarali muloqotga o‘rgatish, tilni
o‘zlashtirish va ishlatish qobiliyatini yaxshilash ta’lim muassasalarining asosiy vazifalaridan
biri hisoblanadi[5]. O‘qituvchi, faqatgina bilim beruvchi emas, balki o‘quvchilarni o‘z fikrlarini
erkin ifodalashga, fikrni mantiqiy ravishda bayon qilishga, so‘zlash madaniyatiga o‘rgatadigan
shaxsdir. Shuning uchun, bo‘lajak o‘qituvchilarni tayyorlashda kommunikativ kompetensiya
asosiy e’tibor markazida bo‘lishi kerak.
Adabiyotlar tahlili: Verbal kommunikatsiya va pedagogik muloqotning psixologik
aspektlarini o‘rganish, ta’lim jarayonining samaradorligini oshirish uchun zarurdir. Ko‘plab
ilmiy tadqiqotlar verbal kommunikatsiya va pedagogik muloqotning o‘quvchilarni
rivojlantirishdagi ahamiyatini, psixologik aspektlarini va o‘qituvchining kommunikativ
kompetensiyasining o‘quvchilar bilan ta’lim jarayonida bo‘lishidagi muhim rolini yoritib
kelmoqda. Maqolada adabiyotlar tahlili asosida ushbu mavzu bo‘yicha olib borilgan ilmiy
izlanishlar va mavjud nazariy yondashuvlar tahlil qilinadi. Bir qator psixologlar va pedagoglar
verbal kommunikatsiyaning pedagogik jarayondagi ahamiyatini ta’kidlagan. Xususan,
L.Vygotsky o‘zining “Ta’lim va rivojlanish” asarida verbal kommunikatsiya orqali
o‘quvchilarning psixologik holatini shakllantirish va ularning fikrlarining rivojlanishini nazarda
tutadi[6]. Vygotsky tilni rivojlantirishning psixologik asoslari, muloqotning o‘quvchi va
o‘qituvchi o‘rtasidagi bog‘lanishdagi ahamiyatini o‘rganadi. U, verbal kommunikatsiya orqali
o‘quvchilarning ichki dialogini o‘stirish va ularni o‘z fikrlarini mustaqil ravishda bayon qilishga
o‘rgatish ta’lim jarayonining asosiy maqsadi ekanligini ta’kidlaydi. Uning nazariyasiga ko‘ra,
o‘qituvchi va o‘quvchi o‘rtasidagi kommunikativ aloqalar o‘quvchining rivojlanishiga bevosita
ta’sir qiladi, chunki til muloqot va tafakkur o‘rtasidagi bog‘lanishni ta’minlaydi. O‘qituvchining
verbal kommunikatsiya uslubi, uning pedagogik muloqotda qanday o‘rin tutishi, o‘quvchilarga
ta’lim berishda qanday samaralar keltirishi haqida ko‘plab ilmiy ishlar mavjud. Misol uchun,
E.G.Gertsen “Pedagogik kommunikatsiya” asarida o‘qituvchining verbal muloqoti ta’lim
jarayonida muhim ahamiyatga ega ekanligini ta’kidlagan[7]. U, o‘qituvchi o‘z so‘zlari bilan
o‘quvchilarning qiziqishlarini uyg‘otishi, muloqotda bo‘lgan ta’sirini kuchaytirishi kerakligini,
shu bilan birga, o‘quvchilarning o‘zini erkin ifodalashlariga imkon yaratish zarurligini
ko‘rsatadi. Gertsenning ta’kidlashicha, o‘qituvchi o‘zining muloqot uslubi va tilni ishlatish
tarziga e’tibor qaratishi, shuningdek, o‘quvchilar bilan aloqada bo‘lishda tushunarli va aniq
bo‘lishi lozim. O‘qituvchilarning kommunikativ kompetensiyasining ta’lim jarayonidagi
ahamiyati haqida bir qator ilmiy ishlar mavjud. A. K. Markova o‘zining "Pedagogik
kompetensiya" asarida o‘qituvchilarning kommunikativ kompetensiyasini o‘qitishning samarali
metodikasi sifatida tasvirlaydi[8]. Markova o‘qituvchining so‘zlash uslubining, uning
qobiliyatining va kommunikativ ko‘nikmalarining talabalarning ta’lim faoliyatiga qanday ta’sir

ehtiyotkorligi, aql-idrokni, emotsional holatni va ijtimoiy nuqtai nazarni inobatga olishi bilan
chambarchas bog‘liqdir.
Metodologik qism: Ushbu maqolaning metodologik qismi pedagogik muloqotning
psixologik aspektlarini o‘rganish va uning samarali tashkil etilishini ta’minlash uchun muayyan
metod va yondoshuvlarni ko‘rib chiqadi. Muloqot jarayonining psixologik jihatlariga oid ilmiy
tadqiqotlar va metodlar o‘qituvchining kommunikativ kompetensiyasini rivojlantirish,
o‘quvchilarning shaxsiy va akademik muvaffaqiyatini oshirishda samarali hisoblanadi. Maqola
o‘quvchilarga muloqotning psixologik elementlarini qanday qilib samarali o‘rgatishni,
o‘qituvchining pedagogik faoliyatida psixologik yondoshuvlarni qanday qo‘llashni va shunga
mos ravishda o‘qituvchilarni tayyorlash metodikasini aniqlashni maqsad qilgan. Quyida
keltirilgan metodologiya metodlar va yondoshuvlarni o‘rganishga qaratilgan. Eksperimental
metod, pedagogik psixologiyada eng keng tarqalgan va samarali metodlardan biri hisoblanadi.
Ushbu metod orqali ta’lim jarayonida o‘quvchilarning verbal kommunikatsiya ko‘nikmalarini
rivojlantirish uchun konkret pedagogik tajribalar va o‘quvchilarning kommunikativ
kompetensiyasini oshirish maqsadida testlar, savollar va anketalar ishlatiladi. Eksperimentlar,
o‘qituvchining kommunikativ yondoshuvlarining ta’lim samaradorligiga qanday ta’sir qilishini
o‘rganishga yordam beradi. Shu maqsadda, o‘quvchilar bilan suhbatlar, rolli o‘yinlar va
o‘qituvchi tomonidan tashkil etilgan guruh muhokamalari orqali tajriba olib boriladi.
Eksperiment davomida o‘quvchilarning o‘zgarishi va pedagogik muloqotning samaradorligi
haqida ma’lumotlar yig‘iladi. Bundan tashqari, o‘qituvchilar uchun maxsus metodik kurslar va
treninglar tashkil etiladi, bu orqali ular pedagogik muloqotning psixologik jihatlarini qanday
samarali qo‘llashni o‘rganishadi. Olingan ma’lumotlar natijasida o‘quvchilarning verbal
kommunikatsiya va muloqotdagi psixologik jihatlariga ta’sir qiluvchi omillarni aniq belgilash
imkoniyati paydo bo‘ladi. Sotsiometrik metod muloqotning ijtimoiy jihatlarini o‘rganish uchun
ishlatiladi. Bu metod orqali guruh ichidagi aloqalar, o‘quvchilar o‘rtasidagi kommunikatsiya va
ijtimoiy munosabatlar tahlil qilinadi. Muloqotning samaradorligi faqat individuallar bilan emas,
balki guruhda qanday o‘rnatilganligini ham tushunish zarur. Sotsiometrik metod yordamida
guruhdagi ijtimoiy dinamikani va o‘quvchilarning o‘zaro ta’sirini o‘rganish mumkin. Misol
uchun, o‘quvchilar o‘rtasida ijtimoiy muloqot o‘rnatilishi, guruhdagi o‘rni va o‘quvchilarning
verbal kommunikatsiya ko‘nikmalarining o‘zaro ta’siri sotsiometrik testlar orqali o‘lchanadi.
Natijalar asosida guruhdagi psixologik jarayonlar va o‘quvchilar orasidagi kommunikatsiya
samaradorligini oshirishga qaratilgan metodik tavsiyalar ishlab chiqiladi. Psixodiagnostik
metodlar, o‘quvchilarning muloqotga tayyorligi, kommunikativ kompetensiyasi va shaxsiy
xususiyatlarini aniqlash uchun qo‘llaniladi. Ushbu metod yordamida o‘quvchilarning verbal
kommunikatsiya ko‘nikmalarini, ularda mavjud bo‘lgan emotsional intellektni, muloqotda
yuzaga keladigan to‘siqlarni va o‘quvchilarning kommunikatsiya uslublarini tahlil qilish
mumkin.
Natijalar: Ushbu maqolada verbal kommunikatsiya orqali samarali pedagogik
muloqotni shakllantirishning psixologik aspektlari tahlil qilindi. Tadqiqot natijalari,

o‘qituvchilarning kommunikativ kompetensiyasini rivojlantirish va uning ta’lim jarayonidagi
o‘quvchilarga ta’sirini yaxshilashga qaratilgan muhim metodik yondoshuvlar va metodlarni
o‘rganishga yordam berdi. Verbal kommunikatsiya ko‘nikmalarining ahamiyati tadqiqotda
o‘qituvchilarning muloqot qilish qobiliyati o‘quvchilarning ishonchini oshirishi, ularning erkin
fikr bildirishlariga yordam berishi ko‘rsatildi. Psixologik jihatlar esa o‘quvchilarning
motivatsiyasini kuchaytirib, ta’lim jarayonidagi faoliyatini yaxshilashga ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Eksperimental va sotsiometrik metodlar orqali o‘quvchilar orasidagi ijtimoiy aloqalar va
guruhdagi munosabatlarning rivojlanishi kuzatildi. Psixodiagnostik metodlar orqali
o‘quvchilarning psixologik xususiyatlari tahlil qilindi va ularga muloqot ko‘nikmalarini
rivojlantirishda samarali yordam ko‘rsatilishi belgilandi. Natijalar, o‘qituvchilarning muloqot
uslublarining o‘quvchilarga ijobiy ta’sir ko‘rsatishini, ularda ijtimoiy kompetensiyani
rivojlantirishni ko‘rsatdi. O‘quvchilarning motivatsiyasini oshirishda muloqotning psixologik
jihatlari muhim rol o‘ynaydi, bu esa o‘quvchilar orasida o‘zaro yordam va hamkorlikni
kuchaytiradi. Zamonaviy axborot texnologiyalarining qo‘llanilishi, o‘quvchilarning
kommunikativ ko‘nikmalarini yanada rivojlantiradi, shu bilan birga o‘qituvchilarning
pedagogik yondoshuvlarini zamonaviy talablar bilan moslashtiradi. Bu usullar va metodlar
o‘qituvchilarni tayyorlash jarayonini yanada samarali va jahon andozalariga moslashtirishga
yordam beradi.
Muxokama: Verbal kommunikatsiya orqali samarali pedagogik muloqotni
shakllantirishning psixologik aspektlari zamonaviy ta’lim jarayonida katta ahamiyat kasb etadi.
Maqolada keltirilgan natijalar, o‘qituvchilarning muloqot ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishning
o‘quvchilarning psixologik rivojlanishiga qanday ta’sir ko‘rsatishini ko‘rsatib berdi. Bu
o‘rganishning o‘quvchilarning motivatsiyasi, ularning o‘zaro munosabatlari, va o‘qituvchi bilan
interaktiv aloqalariga qanday tasir o‘tkazishi haqidagi ilg‘or bilimlarni kengaytirishga yordam
berdi. Muloqotning samarali bo‘lishi, shuningdek, o‘quvchilarning kognitiv va emotsional
holatlariga ta’sir ko‘rsatib, ta’lim jarayonining umumiy samaradorligini oshiradi. Bundan
tashqari, o‘qituvchilarning kommunikativ kompetensiyasi va ularning pedagogik metodlaridagi
muhim psixologik jihatlar haqida olib borilgan tahlil, ta’lim jarayonini samarali boshqarish va
tashkil etish uchun zarur bo‘lgan metodik yondoshuvlarni aniqlashga yordam berdi.
O‘qituvchilarning kommunikativ malakalarini rivojlantirish, ularning muloqot qilish usullarini
boyitib, o‘quvchilarga ta’limni yanada samarali tarzda etkazish imkonini yaratadi. Bu esa
o‘quvchilarning o‘qish faoliyatiga bo‘lgan motivatsiyasini oshirib, ularning bilim olishdagi
muvaffaqiyatlariga ijobiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Psixologik jihatlar ham o‘quvchilarning
kommunikativ ko‘nikmalarini shakllantirishda o‘rganilgan muhim omillardan biridir. Tadqiqot
natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, o‘quvchilarning psixologik xususiyatlarini hisobga olish, ularning
o‘zaro munosabatlarini mustahkamlash, va ularni faol o‘qish jarayoniga jalb qilishda katta rol
o‘ynaydi. Buning uchun o‘qituvchilar o‘zlarining pedagogik yondoshuvlarini psixologik
jihatdan moslashtirishlari zarur. O‘quvchilarning psixologik holatlari, ularning kayfiyati va
ijtimoiy aloqalari, o‘qituvchining muloqotdagi til uslubi va uslublari bilan bevosita bog‘liq.

Shuning uchun pedagogik muloqotning psixologik jihatlarini yaxshi tushunish,
o‘qituvchilarning o‘z ishini yaxshilashiga imkon yaratadi. Bundan tashqari, texnologik
rivojlanishning ta’limga ta’siri ham alohida ta’kidlanishi kerak. Maqolada, zamonaviy axborot
texnologiyalarining pedagogik muloqotda qo‘llanilishi ham o‘quvchilarning kommunikativ
kompetensiyasini rivojlantirishga qanday yordam berishi ko‘rsatildi. O‘qituvchilar,
texnologiyalarni pedagogik jarayonga kiritish orqali o‘quvchilarning muloqot qilish
qobiliyatlarini yuqori darajaga olib chiqishlari mumkin. Shu bilan birga, bu yangi metodlarning
o‘quvchilar uchun eng samarali tarzda qo‘llanilishini ta’minlash uchun, o‘qituvchilarning
axborot texnologiyalari bilan tanishligi va ularni samarali tarzda ishlata olish qobiliyati zarur.
Lekin, texnologiyalarni qo‘llashda ehtiyotkorlik ham zarur. Zamonaviy texnologiyalarni
pedagogik jarayonlarga integratsiya qilishda, o‘qituvchilarning texnik bilimlari va
o‘zgaruvchan pedagogik yondoshuvlarga tayyorligi muhim omil hisoblanadi. Aks holda,
texnologiyalar ta’lim jarayonini soddalashtirish o‘rniga murakkablashtirishi mumkin. Bu esa
o‘quvchilarning muloqot qilish ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishda to‘siqlar yaratadi. Bundan
tashqari, muloqotning shaxsiy jihatlari ham o‘rganilishi zarur.
Xulosa: Maqolada verbal kommunikatsiya orqali samarali pedagogik muloqotni
shakllantirishning psixologik aspektlari tahlil qilindi. Tadqiqotlar natijasida o‘qituvchilarning
muloqot ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirish, o‘quvchilarning motivatsiyasini oshirish va ta’lim
jarayonidagi ijtimoiy aloqalarni mustahkamlashga katta ahamiyat berilishi zarurligi ko‘rsatildi.
Psixologik jihatlar va kommunikativ metodlarni o‘quvchilarning individual xususiyatlariga
moslashtirish, ta’lim samaradorligini oshiradi. Zamonaviy axborot texnologiyalarining
qo‘llanilishi ham pedagogik muloqotni samarali tashkil etishda muhim omil bo‘lib,
o‘quvchilarning muloqot qobiliyatlarini rivojlantirishda katta rol o‘ynaydi. Shu bilan birga,
o‘qituvchilarning metodik va psixologik bilimlarini oshirish, ta’lim jarayonini innovatsion
yondashuvlar bilan boyitishga imkon yaratadi.

Annotatsiya: Jahonda ayollar migratsiyasi qashshoqlik, gender tengsizlik, moliyaviy
farovonlik xohishi kabi sabablar bilan bir qatorda ijtimoiy frustratsiya (hozirgi holatidan
qoniqmaslik) ayollarga imkoniyatlarni ortishi, gender rollarni tenglashishi, karyeraga intilishi
kabilar ayollarning erkinlikka, mustaqillikka intilishishini ortib borishiga motiv vazifasini
bajarmoqda. Migratsiya oqimlarining feminizatsiyasi, yaʼni migrantlarning umumiy sonida
ayollar ulushining oshishi ekspertlar tomonidan xalqaro mehnat migratsiyasi rivojlanishining
eng yangi bosqichining oʻziga xos xususiyati sifatida eʼtirof etilmoqda. Bu koʻp jihatdan
globallashuv jarayonlari bilan birga keladigan jahon iqtisodiyotidagi tarkibiy oʻzgarishlar bilan
bogʻliq.

THE IMPACT OF LABOR MIGRATION ON THE PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL
STATE OF WOMEN
Abstract: In the world, womenʼs migration, along with reasons such as poverty, gender
inequality, and the desire for financial independence, is motivated by social frustration
(dissatisfaction with the current situation), increased opportunities for women, equalization of
gender roles, and the desire for a career, which serve as a motive for womenʼs increasing desire
for freedom and independence. The feminization of migration flows, that is, an increase in the
share of women in the total number of migrants, is recognized by experts as a characteristic
feature of the latest stage in the development of international labor migration. This is largely
due to structural changes in the world economy that accompany globalization processes.
Keywords: migration, femininity, life satisfaction, interpersonal relationships, labor
resource, motivation, need, independence, hierarchy.

ВЛИЯНИЕ ТРУДОВОЙ МИГРАЦИИ НА ПСИХОЭМОЦИОНАЛЬНОЕ
СОСТОЯНИЕ ЖЕНЩИН
Аннотация: В мире женская миграция мотивируется такими причинами, как
бедность, гендерное неравенство и стремление к финансовой независимости, а также
социальная фрустрация (неудовлетворенность текущим положением), возросшие
возможности для женщин, выравнивание гендерных ролей и стремление к карьере.
Феминизация миграционных потоков, то есть увеличение доли женщин в общей
численности мигрантов, признается специалистами характерной чертой новейшего этапа
развития международной трудовой миграции. Во многом это обусловлено структурными
изменениями в мировой экономике, сопровождающими процессы глобализации.
Ключевые слова: миграция, женственность, удовлетворенность жизнью,
межличностные отношения, трудовой ресурс, мотивация, потребность, независимость,
иерархия.
KIRISH. Birlashgan Millatlar Tashkilotining Iqtisodiy va Ijtimoiy Kengashi
maʼlumotlariga koʻra, 1990-yillarda xalqaro migrantlar orasida xotin-qizlar soni 75 mln nafarni
tashkil etgan. 2020 yilga kelib, mazkur koʻrsatkich 1.8 baravar ortib, 134 mln nafarga yetgan.
Bu ortish, asosan, mehnatga layoqatli yoshdagi xotin-qizlar hisobiga toʻgʻri keladi. Xalqaro
Mehnat Tashkiloti maʼlumotlariga koʻra, xotin-qizlarning 70 mln nafari mehnat migrantlari
ekanligi qayd etilgan [1]. Migratsiya jarayonida va undan keyin xotin-qizlarning migratsiyaga
qaror qilish tajribasi erkak migrantlarning tajribasidan farq qiladi. Bu jarayon davomida ayollar
zoʻravonlikka moyil boʻlishi, mehnat bozorida gender tengsizligiga duch kelish ehtimolligi
yuqori hisoblanadi. Garchi xotin-qizlar bunday tajribalarni boshdan kechirgan boʻlsalar ham,
vaqt oʻtishi bilan gender rollari keltirib chiqaradigan stereotiplari oʻzgarib boradi. Iqtisodiy
mustaqillik va rivojlangan mamlakatlarda teng huquqlar ayollarni oiladagi oʻrnini
mustahkamlaydi.
Migratsiya harakati shaxslar va jamiyatlarning turmush tarziga katta taʼsir koʻrsatadi. Bu
jarayonni davlatlar ishtiroksiz tasavvur qilish qiyin. Qolaversa, migratsiya jarayonlarida ayollar
va erkaklar turli tajribalarni boshdan kechirishlari gender tenglikka nisbatan sezgir integratsiya
siyosatini qabul qilishni taqozo etadi. Bugungi kunda xalqaro migratsiyada noiqtisodiy
migratsiya oqimlari bilan bir qatorda norasmiy migratsiyasi ulushi oshib bormoqda. Natijada,
qabul qiluvchi mamlakatlar migrantlarning nisbatan ojiz qatlamlari sanalgan ayollar va
bolalarni joylashtirish va ular uchun zaruriy ijtimoiy shart-sharoitlarni yaratib berishda
moliyaviy muammolarga duch kelmoqda.
ADABIYOTLAR TAHLILI VA METODLAR. YUNISEFning hisobotiga koʻra,
dunyoning boshqa mintaqalariga nisbatan migratsiya taʼsir koʻrsatgan bolalarning katta ulushi
Osiyo davlatlariga toʻgʻri keladi. «Migratsiya muammosi nafaqat Markaziy Osiyoda boʻlibgina
qolmasdan, global xarakterga ega. Tobora koʻproq odamlar yaxshi hayot qidirib, oʻz vatanini
va oilalarini tark etmoqdalar» — deb taʼkidlaydi Yevropa Ittifoqining Oʻzbekistondagi

delegatsiyasi rahbari Eduard Striprays. Biroq yaqqol iqtisodiy manfaatlardan tashqari
migratsiya boshqa jiddiy oqibatlarga ham olib kelishini koʻramiz. Ushbu muammolarni hal
qilish uchun mazkur multimintaqaviy tashabbusni qoʻllab-quvvatlashga qaror qilindi. Loyiha
doirasida amalga oshirilayotgan kompleks ahamiyatli chora-tadbirlar mehnat migratsiyasida
boʻlgan ota-onalarning qarovsiz qolgan bolalarni ijtimoiy himoyalashni takomillashtirishga
xizmat qildi [2].
Mazkur band davomida oʻrganilgan muammolari masalalardan kelib chiqib quyidagi
xulosalarimizni ilgari suramiz:
Birinchidan, zamonaviy migratsion oqimlar feminlashuv tendensiyasiga ega boʻlib
bormoqda. Mazkur tendensiyaning kuchayib borishi “retsipiyent” davlatlar farovonligini
oshirishga xizmat qilsa, “donor” davlatlar migrant ayollar tomonidan kiritilayotgan pul va
sotsial kapital (yangi gʻoyalar, koʻnikma va bilimlar)ga ega boʻladi.
Ikkinchidan, boshqa mamlakatga koʻchib oʻtish migrant-ayollar uchun nafaqat moddiy
holatini yaxshilash, balki, yangi gʻoyalar, sotsial meʼyorlar, bilimlar bilan tanishish va ularni
oʻzlashtirish orqali ijtimoiy hayotda faollik koʻrsatishga turtki boʻladi.
Uchinchidan, xotin-qizlar mehnat migratsiyasi salbiy oqibatlarni keltirib chiqarish
ehtimoli baland boʻlgan ijtimoiy xatarli jarayon sanaladi. Bunda “donor” davlatlar qimmatli
mehnat resurslarini yoʻqotsa, “retsipiyent” davlatlarda norasmiy migratsiya oqibatlar
kriminologik holatni chigallashtiradi, sotsial konfliktlarni keskinlashtiradi.
Toʻrtinchidan, migrant-ayollar aksariyat vaziyatlarda boshqa davlatga koʻchish qarorini
qabul qilinishida faollik koʻrsatadi. Ayrim vaziyatlarda xotin-qizlar oila boshligʻi boʻlmasa-da
(eri, ota-onasi bilan yashab turib) oʻzi va oilasining koʻchib ketishida tashabbus koʻrsatadi.
Beshinchidan, Markaziy Osiyo davlatlaridan yaqin xorijga ketgan migrant-ayollar gender
stereotiplar va anʼanaviy iqtisodiy-ijtimoiy maqomining oʻzgarishiga turtki beradi. Ular yoki
yolgʻiz, yoki oila aʼzolari bilan pul ishlab topish uchun turli davlatlarga ketmoqdalar [3].
NATIJALAR VA MUHOKAMA. Jahonda ayollar migratsiyaning hamma koʻrinishlari
tezlik bilan rivojlanmoqda. Shulardan biri majburiy migratsiyadir. Majburiy migratsiyaning
yuzaga kelish sabablari turlichadir. Masalan siyosiy mamlakatdagi notinchlik, mintaqaviy
muammolar (suv taqchilligi, yashash uchun sharoitni yoʻqolib borishi) qashshoqlik.
Qashshoqlik sabab migratsiya jarayoni ortib borishi tabiiy jarayon hisoblanadi, ammo oʻta
qashshoqlikda yashovchi mamlakatdagi ayollar ham migratsiya qila olishmaydi, chunki
transport muammosi, boshqa davlatga borgungacha boʻlgan xarajatlar, shu bilan bir qatorda oʻta
qashshoq hududlarda yashaydigan ayollarning maʼlumot darajasi ham muammoli holat
hisoblanadi. Ayollar migratsiya asosan rivojlanish bosqichidagi mamlakatlarda koʻp sodir
boʻladi. Rivojlanayotgan mamlakatlarda taʼlim ham kasblar ham yashash sharoiti va chetga
chiqish imkoniyatlari ham rivojlanib boradi. Fuqarolar taʼlim olish, yaxshi mablagʻ topish , eng
oldi hunarlarni oʻrganish uchun migratsiya qilishadi. Ayollar hozirda erkaklardan mustaqil
migratsiya qilishi koʻpaymoqda. Bunga sabab gender tenglik va ayollar uchun imkoniyatning
oshib borayotganligi hisoblanadi. Shunday boʻlsa-da ayollar hamon migratsiya jarayonida orqa
151

ikkinchi darajali boʻlib koʻrinmoqda va migratsiya qurbonlari orasida ayollar yetakchilik
qilmoqda [4].
Ayollar migratsiyasi oila institutini anʼanaviy shaklini oʻzgarishiga sabab boʻladi.
Anʼanaviy oilalar bir uyda istiqomat qilishi, moddiy, maʼnaviy, ruhiy tarafdan oʻzaro qoʻllabquvvatlasa, migrant oilalarda oila aʼzolari boshqa mamlakatlarda yashashiga toʻgʻri kelmoqda.
Ayniqsa oilada ayol kishining migratsiyada boʻlishi oila aʼzolarining tarqalib ketishiga sabab
boʻlmoqda. Chunki turmush oʻrtogʻi migratsiya ketgan ayol farzandlarini tarbiya qilib, uy
yumushlari va oilada erkak bajarishi lozim boʻlgan vazifalarni ham oʻz zimmasiga oladi. Ammo
ayollarning migratsiyaga ketishi farzandlarning vasiylar, qarindoshlar qarmogʻida qolishga olib
keladi. Bu oilalarning maʼnaviy, psixologik, ijtimoiy, akseologik muammolarning kelib
chiqishiga va oilaviy ajrimlar oshishiga olib keladi [5].

1-rasm. Xotin-qizlarning migratsiya motivi boʻyicha maʼlumot
Ekspertlarning taʼkidlashicha, mehnat migratsiyasiga chiqishning asosiy sabablari
oilaviy kelishmovchilik – migratsiyaning eng yuqori sababi boʻlib, 31,3%ni tashkil etgan. Bu
koʻrsatkich oilaviy ziddiyatlar va shaxsiy muammolar xotin-qizlarning migratsiyaga chiqishiga
taʼsir koʻrsatayotganligini koʻrsatadi. Ayollar migratsiyasining ajrashganlik va uy-joysiz
qolganligini koʻrsatgan boʻlib 24,0% ni tashkil etgan. Bu holat ayollarning iqtisodiy va ijtimoiy
himoyasizligidan dalolat beradi. Iqtisodiy yetishmovchilik sababini koʻrsatganlar 19,3% tashkil
etgan. Bundan koʻrinib turibdiki, xotin-qizlar orasida iqtisodiy barqarorlik izlab migratsiyaga
chiqish juda keng tarqalgan. Ekspertlarning taʼkidlashicha – 20,0% migrantlar “turmush qurish
uchun” migratsiyaga chiqayotganlarni tashkil etadi. Bu koʻrsatkich migratsiyaning ijtimoiy
jihatini aks ettiradi.

Xotin-qizlarning tashqi mehnat migratsiyasiga ketgan duch kelgan qiyinchiliklari tahlil
qilinganda 69% muhitga moslasha olmaslik, 235 tilni va madaniyatni bilmaslikni, 2% turar-joy
muammosini, 2% oʼzini yolgʼiz, himoyasiz his qilganini, 2% sogʼlikni tiklashni, 2% boshqa
turdagi muammolarni qayd etib oʼtishgan. Demak, xotin-qizlardagi asosiy muammo bu
moslasha olmaslik boʼlib qolmoqda. Shuningdek, oʼzga davlatning madaniyat, tilini bilmaslik
ham xotin-qizlarning mehnat migratsiyasidagi asosiy qiyinchiliklar sirasiga kirmoqda.
Xotin-qizlar migratsiyasiga sabab boʻluvchi omillar Oʻzbekistonda ishsizlik darajasining
yuqoriligi va yurt ichida munosib ish topishning qiyinligi ayollarning migratsiyaga moyilligini
kuchaytirmoqda. Tadqiqot natijalariga koʻra migrant ayollarning 86% oʻzining moddiy ahvolini
yaxshilashni migratsiyaning asosiy ijobiy tomoni deb baholagan. Shuningdek, shaxsiy omillar
ham mavjud boʻlib, ajrashgan ayollarning iqtisodiy mustaqillikka erishish istagini inobatga
olish kerak. Tadqiqotda qatnashgan migrant ayollarning 31% yaqini ajrashganlar ekanligi bu
tendensiyani quvvatlaydi. Tadqiqot jarayonida madaniy va ijtimoiy bosimlar mavjudligi
kuzatiladi. Xususan, oʻz mamlakatlarida shaxsiy mustaqillik va shaxs sifatida oʻzini namoyon
etish imkoniyatining cheklanganligi ham migratsiyaning ragʻbatlantiruvchi omillaridan biri
boʻlib xizmat qilmoqda [6].

Migratsiyaning oʻziga xos ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy tomonlari boʻlib, xotin-qizlar tomonidan
oilaga yuboriladigan mablagʻlar mahalliy iqtisodiyotni qoʻllab-quvvatlab, oilaviy daromadlar
darajasini oshirmoqda, shu bilan birga vatanda qolgan farzandlarining taʼlim olishi uchun
moddiy taʼminot vazifasini oʻtaydi. Turkiyaga borgan xotin-qizlar shaxsiy tajribasini oshirishib
yangi koʻnikmalarga ega boʻlishmoqda, bu esa ularning mehnat bozorida raqobatbardoshligini
oshirishi mumkin. Biroq salbiy oqibatlarni ham inobatga olish kerak, Migrantlarning 74%
muhitga moslashishda qiyinchiliklar koʻrayotganini taʼkidlagan. Bu, ayniqsa, tilni bilmaslik va
ijtimoiy qoʻllab-quvvatlashning yoʻqligi bilan bogʻliq. Bu holat kuchli ruhiy va jismoniy
charchoqni kelib chiqishiga sabab boʻladi. 85,2% migrant ayollar ish beruvchilar bilan rasmiy
shartnoma tuzmagan. Bu koʻrsatkich migrant xotin-qizlarda huquqiy himoyaning yoʻqligiga
dalolat boʻlib mehnat huquqlarining poymol qilinishiga olib kelmoqda. Migrant ayollarning
77% farzandlarini vatanida qoldirgan, bu migratsiyaning oilaviy munosabatlarga salbiy taʼsiri
boʻlib, bolalarda ruhiy va ijtimoiy qiyinchiliklarni keltirib chiqarmoqda.
XULOSA. Sanoat va ilmiy texnika sohalarini rivojlanishi, globallashuv va
raqamlashtirishning kuchayishi jamiyat hayotiga oʻz taʼsirini oʻtkazmoqda. Bu oʻz navbatida
ayollar migratsiyasini tez suratlarda rivojlanishiga turtki vazifasini bajarmoqda. Migratsiya ikki
jins vakilining ham hayotiy qarashlarini oʻzgarishiga olib keladigan jarayon boʻlsa-da, ammo
ayollar hissiyotga moyilligi baland boʻlgani bois, ularning turmush tarziga, maʼnaviy
qadriyatlariga katta taʼsir oʻtkazadi. Qadriyatlar shaxsning ehtiyojlari va manfaatlari,
psixikasini hissiy va irodaviy mexanizmlari bilan uzviy bogʻliqdir. Qadriyatlarni avloddan
avlodga yetkazib berishda ayollar asosiy rol oʻynaydi. Chunki ayol farzandni dunyoga
keltirib,uni katta qilish jarayonida oʻz qadriyatlarini bevosita singdirib boradi. Migratsiya
jarayonida shaxsda ijtimoiy va shaxsiy qadriyatlar oʻrtasida toʻqnashuv sodir boʻladi. Migrant
yangi ijtimoiy muhitni qadriyatlarini tan olmasligi salbiy vaziyatlar yuzaga kelish ehtimolini
hosil qiladi. Bu vaziyatda shaxsni idrok darajasi bilan jamiyatni idrok darajasi oʻrtasidagi
integratsiyalashuvi muhimdir. Hozirda zamonaviy oilalarda qadriyatlar oʻzgarishi yuz
bermoqda. Ayniqsa boshqa davlatga koʻchib oʻtgan oilalar yoki migratsiyaga ketgan
ayollarning oilaviy qadriyatlarida keskinlik yuzaga kelmoqda. O.E.Aleksanovaning fikricha
ijtimoiy faollik va turmush tarzining urf-odatlar, til, qadriyatlar yoʻnalishida keskin oʻzgarishi
migrant ayolda psixo-emotsional tushkunlikka hamda izolyatsiyaga moyillikni ortishiga olib
keladi. Migrant ayollardagi bu oʻzgarishlar ularning oila aʼzolari bilan munosabatlariga ham
salbiy taʼsirini oʻtkazmasdan qolmaydi. Bu kabi muammolar yechimi bilan sotsiologlar,
huquqshunoslar, iqtisodchilar va psixologlar ilmiy izlanishlar olib bormoqda, ammo migrant
ayollarning ijtimoiy psixologik muammolarini oʻrganishga qaratilgan tadqiqotlar yetarli emas.

Hozirgi kunda bolalarning shaxsiy rivojlanishi va ularning ijtimoiy moslashuvi
masalasi psixologiya fanida dolzarb mavzulardan biri hisoblanadi. Ayniqsa, kichik maktab
yoshidagi bolalar o‘z ijtimoiy identifikatsiyasini shakllantirayotgan davrda oilaviy
munosabatlarning ularga ko‘rsatadigan ta’siri alohida ahamiyatga ega. Oila – bu bola uchun
birinchi ijtimoiy muhit bo‘lib, unda u axloqiy qadriyatlar, hissiy barqarorlik va kommunikativ
ko‘nikmalarni
egallaydi.
Bola oila timsolida jamiyatning ijtimoiy-ma’naviy qiyofasini ko‘radi, jamiyat talablari
mohiyatini ilk bora shu kichik jamoa orasida, oilaviy munosabatlarni tashkil etish jarayonida
anglaydi.
Oilaviy munosabatlar – ota-onalar yoki bolaning kamoloti uchun mas’ul bo‘lgan
shaxslar (buva-buvilar) hamda farzandlar o‘rtasida turli yo‘nalishlarda tashkil etiluvchi
munosabatlardir.
Oilaviy munosabatlar farzandlarning aqliy, ruhiy kamolotini ta’minlab, ota-onalarda
o‘ziga hos faollikni ham yuzaga keltiradi. Xususan, farzandlarning bevosita ta’siri tufayli
ularning qiziqish hamda faoliyatlari doirasi kengayadi, o‘zaro aloqalari mazmunan boyib
boradi, real hayot mohiyatini chuqurroq anglash, ya’ni, farzandlar kamoloti, kelajagi timsolida
o‘z umri davomiyligini kurish holati ro‘y beradi.
Oila va oila ichidagi munosabatlar muammolari doimo dolzarb bo‘lib kelgan va
tadqiqotchilarda qiziqish uyg‘otgan. Ammo, ehtimol, so‘nggi yillarda zamonaviy oilaning
inqirozli holati bilan bog‘liq holda oilaviy hayot masalalariga alohida qiziqish paydo bo‘ldi.
Tadqiqotlarning aksariyati oila hayotining iqtisodiy, ijtimoiy va pedagogik jihatlarini tahlil
qilishga bag‘ishlangan. Farzand tarbiyasi, shaxs kamoloti, kattalar va bolalar farovonligi bilan
bog‘liq ko‘plab masalalarni oilaga tayanmasdan hal qilib bo‘lmaydi. Bola shaxsini
shakllantirishda oilaning fundamental ahamiyati va ajralmasligi foydasiga ko‘plab faktlar
aniqlangan.
Tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, sog‘lom oilaviy muhitda voyaga yetayotgan bolalar
ko‘proq o‘ziga ishonuvchan, muloqotga ochiq va barqaror shaxs sifatida shakllanadi
(Baumrind, 1991; Maccoby & Martin, 1983). Shu bois, ushbu maqolada kichik maktab
yoshidagi bolalarning oilaviy munosabatlar asosidagi shaxsiy xususiyatlari tahlil qilinadi.
MAVZUGA OID ADABIYOTLARNING TAHLILI
Maqolada kichik maktab yoshidagi bolalarning shaxsiy xususiyatlariga oilaviy
munosabatlarning ta’sirini o‘rganishda asosiy nazariy manbalar sifatida quyidagi muhim
psixologik ishlarga tayanilgan: D.Baumrind, D. (1991) “ The influence of parenting style on
adolescent competence and substance use”asari va 2 Maccoby, E. E. va Martin, J. A. (1983)”
Socialization in the context of the familyasarlari olingan.
Diana Baumrindning ota-onalik
uslublari haqidagi tadqiqoti bolalarning shaxsiy rivojlanishiga tarbiya uslublarining qanday
ta’sir ko‘rsatishini tushunishda muhim ahamiyatga ega. Uning avtoritar, demokratik va ruxsat
beruvchi (liberal) uslublar haqidagi tasnifi, bolalarning o‘ziga ishonchi, ijtimoiy faolligi va
ruhiy holatiga ta’sir qiluvchi asosiy omillarni tushuntirib beradi. Maqoladagi roli: Bu manba

maqoladagi oilaviy munosabatlar va bola xulq-atvori o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlikni tahlil qilishda
nazariy asos bo‘lib xizmat qilgan.
Mazkur asar oilaviy ijtimoiylashuv jarayonini, ayniqsa bola va ota-ona o‘rtasidagi o‘zaro
ta’sirni chuqur tahlil qiladi. Mualliflar oilaning psixologik iqlimi va ota-onaning tarbiyaviy
yondashuvining bola shaxsiyati va ijtimoiy ko‘nikmalariga ta’sirini empirik asosda yoritib
berishgan.
NATIJALAR VA MUHOKAMA.
Tadqiqotimizda jami 108 nafar 7 yoshdan 11 yoshgacha bo‘lgan kichik maktab yoshidagi
bolalar ishtirok etdi. Shundan 53 nafari o‘g‘il bola va 55 nafari qiz bola. Tadqiqotda D. X.
Olson, Dj. Portner, I. Lavinning “Oilaviy moslashuv va jipslik shkalasi”dan foydalanildi. Bu
metodika bolaning oila a’zolariga va atrofdagilarga bo‘lgan munosabatini, shuningdek, shaxsiy
xususiyatlarini aniqlashga yordam beradi.

Tahlil qilingan statistik ma’lumotlar shuni ko‘rsatmoqdaki, bolalarning oilaviy muhitda
shakllanadigan ijtimoiy-psixologik xususiyatlari ularning ijtimoiy munosabatlarida muhim rol
o‘ynaydi. Onaga va otaga bo‘lgan iliq munosabat, ayniqsa onaning farzand hayotidagi roli
kuchli ekani, oilaviy jipslik va emotsional qo‘llab-quvvatlov bolaning o‘zini baholashiga
bevosita ta’sir qilayotganini ko‘rsatadi.
Shuningdek, o‘zini chetga tortish, hukmronlikka intilish, muloqotchanlik va
qiziquvchanlik darajalari bolalarning maktab va sinfdoshlari bilan o‘zaro aloqasini belgilovchi
psixologik faktorlardir. Ushbu ko‘rsatkichlar asosida maktab psixologlari uchun maxsus
161

diagnostika dasturlari ishlab chiqilishi, bolalar bilan individual ishlashga yo‘naltirilgan
yondashuvlar zarurligi yuzaga chiqadi.
Qiziquvchanlik darajasining yuqoriligi, bolaning bilim olishga bo‘lgan ichki ehtiyojining
shakllanganini bildiradi. Bu esa o‘qituvchilar uchun rag‘batlantirish, ochiq savollardan
foydalanish, tanqidiy fikrlashni rag‘batlantirish kabi metodlarni kengroq qo‘llashni tavsiya
etadi.
Shuningdek, respondentlarning do‘stlariga va ustozlariga nisbatan bildirgan
munosabatlari, ularning oilaviy tarbiya va ijtimoiy muhit bilan bog‘liqligini ko‘rsatadi. Kam
ijtimoiylashgan bolalarda ustozlarga ishonch past darajada bo‘lishi mumkin. Shu bois, oilaviy
va maktab muhiti birgalikda bolaning emotsional rivojlanishini ta’minlashi lozim.
XULOSA
Olib borilgan tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, kichik maktab yoshidagi bolalarning
shaxsiy xususiyatlari va ijtimoiy munosabatlaridagi ko‘plab jihatlar oiladagi muhit va
munosabatlar xarakteri bilan bevosita bog‘liq. Ota-onaning mehribonligi, e’tibori, ijtimoiypsixologik qo‘llab-quvvatlovi bolaning shaxsiy taraqqiyotida muhim o‘rin egallaydi. Mazkur
natijalar maktab psixologi, ota-onalar va pedagoglar uchun amaliy tavsiyalar ishlab chiqishda
asos bo‘la oladi.

Bismillahir Rohmanir Rohiym. “Alloh iymon keltirganlarning do‘stidir. Ularni

zulmatlarga chiqarurlar. Ana o‘shalar olov sohiblaridir. Ular unda mangu
qoluvchidirlar”.
Baqara surasi 257-oyat.
Biz oyatda “do‘st” deb tarjima qilgan ibora arab tilida “valiy” deb kelgan bo‘lib, bu siz
bilan bizning tushunchamizdagi “do‘st”dan ko‘ra kengroq tushunchani ifoda qiladi. Bu do‘st,
ishboshi, hamma kerakli narsalarni tayyorlab, ishlarni to‘g‘ri izga solib turuvchi g‘amxo‘rdir.
“Alloh iymon keltirganlarning do‘stidir”.
Ya’ni ishboshisi, g‘amxo‘ridir. Shu boisdan ham
“Ularni zulmatlardan nurga chiqarur”.
Alloh iymon keltirganlarni iymon deb atalgan nurga chiqaradi. Allohning yo‘li, Iymon
yo‘li bitta – nur yo‘lidir. Undan boshqa hamma yo‘llar zulmatdan iboratdir. Shuning uchun ham
oyatda “nur” so‘zi birlikda, “zulmat” so‘zi esa ko‘plikda zikr qilinmoqda. Allohning yo‘lidan
boshqa hamma yo‘llar, qaysi nom bilan atalishidan qat’i nazar, zulmatdir. Alloh taolo iymon
yo‘liga yurganlarni ushbu zulmatlarning barchasidan iymon nuriga chiqaradi. Iymonlilarning
qarshisida boshqa toifa ham bor, ular kufr keltirganlardir. Xo‘sh, ularning holi qanday ekan?
“Kufr keltirganlarning do‘stlari tog‘utlardir”.
Ya’ni kofirlarning ishboshilari, g‘amxo‘rlari Allohning yo‘lidan boshqa yo‘ldagilardir.
Tog‘utning kattasi shaytondir. Shunday ekan, tog‘utlar o‘zlariga ergashganlarga qanday do‘stlik
qiladilar?
“Ularni nurdan zulmatlarga chiqarurlar”.
Tog‘utlar o‘zlariga ergashganlarni iymon nuridan chiqarib, johiliyat zulmatlariga
kiritadilar.
Avval aytilganidek, zulmatlar juda ham ko‘p va ular turli nomlar bilan ataladi. Oqibat
nima bo‘ladi? Oqibatda:
“Ana o‘shalar olov sohiblaridir. Ular unda mangu qoluvchidirlar”.
Yuqorida odamlar ikki toifaga ajrab, ularning ayrimlari kofir, ayrimlari mo‘min bo‘lib
ketganlari bayon qilingan edi.
Mo‘min-mo‘minalar namozlarini tashlamay har qanday holatda ham namoz o‘qishlariga
farishtalarni havaslari kelib, haqqlariga duo qilishlarini va Allohfarishtalariga undaylar bilan
fahrlanishini bilganlarida edi.

qilinadi:
Nabiy sollallohu alayhi vasallam shunday dedilar: Alloh taolo aytadi: Men bandamning
Men haqimdagi gumonidaman.* Meni eslasa, u bilan birgaman. Agar u Meni o‘zi eslasa,
Men ham uni O‘zim eslayman. Agar u Meni bir jamoa ichida eslasa, Men uni ulardan
yaxshiroq jamoa ichida eslayman. Agar u Menga bir qarich yaqinlashsa, Men unga
bir ziro’ yaqinlashaman. Agar u Menga bir ziro’ yaqinlashsa, Men unga bir quloch
164

yaqinlashaman. Agar u Menga yurib kelsa, Men unga chopib boraman
. (Oltin silsila kitobidan Sahihul Buxoriy). Vallohu a’lam!
Yuqoridagi oyat va hadisga to‘xtaladigan bo‘lsak, bandalarning adashish, toyilish yo‘llari
kop ekan. Ularni qutqaruvchi yo‘l faqat Allohga boruvchi yo‘llaridir. Lekin ularni adashish
yo‘llari ko‘plik lafzida keltirild. Demak, insonlarning adashishlari tabiiy holat. Bundan ham
yomoni, qilgan aybiga iqror bo‘lmaslik va nadomat chekmaslikdir. Hech bir inson xatodan holi
emas. Xato qiluvchilarning yaxshisi esa tavba qiluvhchilaridir. Mazkur holatda insonning fikri
(yaxshi gumoni) uning kelajagini belgilab beradi. U agar kechirilishini umid qilsa kechirilishi,
lekin noumid bo’lsa, aybiga yarasha jazolanishi mumkinligi zikr qilindi.
Niyat qalb amalidir. U har bir ishimizning boshi, ham oxiri. Axir amallarimiz
niyatlarimizga qarab baholanadi. Shuning uchun niyatni yaxshi qilaylik.
Bu so‘zimizga “Ko‘prik quruvchi usta” hikoyasi na’muna bo‘lishi mumkin:
Aka-uka otalaridan qolgan hovlida kun kechirishardi. Bir tushunmovchilik sabab
oralariga sovuqchilik tushdi, gaplashmay qo‘yishdi. Kunlar o‘tgani sari o‘rtadagi jarlik
kattalashib borardi. Oxir-oqibat hovlining qarama-qarshi tomonlariga uy solib yashay
boshlashdi.
Bir kuni akaning eshigi taqilladi. Ostonada katta yoshlardagi odam turardi:
— Men ustaman, ish qidirib yuribman. Balki hovlingizda menbop yumush topilib qolar,
— dedi.
— Ha, albatta! Hovlini kesib o‘tgan ariqni ko‘rayapsizmi? O‘tgan haftada ukam kavlatdi,
o‘zicha hovlini ajratib, yerni chegaralab qo‘ydi. Bu yerda yetarlicha taxta bor, — dedi
omborxonasiga ishora qilib. — Siz hovlini butkul ajratish uchun o‘sha ariq bo‘ylab to‘siq qurib
bering.
Usta darhol ishga kirishdi. Taxtalarni olib chiqdi, o‘lchab kesdi, randaladi. Bu orada
ohorli kiyimlarini kiyib olgan aka so‘radi:
— Men bozorga ketayapman. To‘siq uchun yana biror narsa kerak emasmi?
— Rahmat, hamma narsa yetarli, — javob berdi usta.
Kechga yaqin shahardan qaytgan akaning jahli chiqdi. Chunki usta ariq ustiga ko‘prik
qurib qo‘ygandi.
— Men sizga to‘siq quring, degandim-ku! — dedi g‘azab bilan ustaga qarab.
Usta javob berishga og‘iz juftlagandi, uyidan chiqib ko‘prikni ko‘rgan uka ular tomonga
yura boshladi. Akasining xohishi bilan qurildi deb o‘ylab, xursand bo‘lgan uka shoshib
ko‘prikdan o‘tdi va akasini quchoqladi. Ariq qazitgani, qo‘pol muomalasi uchun uzr so‘radi.
Birpasda ikkovlari suhbatga kirishib ketishdi. Bu orada anjomlarini yig‘ishtirib, ketishga
hozirlanayotgan ustaga «Shoshilmang, mehmonimiz bo‘ling», deb taklif qildi aka. U esa:
— Rahmat, qololmayman. Men hali juda ko‘p ko‘priklar qurishim kerak, — dedi
tabassum bilan…
To‘qsoninchi yillarda, ayni bahor chog‘lari tomorqalarda ishlar qizg‘in paytlar. Maktabda
o‘qituvchi bo‘lib ishlardim. O‘quv yili oxirlab borayotganidan hammada charchoq alomatlari
165

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

sezilardi. Men ham hech bo‘lmasa bir hafta dam olish niyatida shifokor tanishimga uchradimda, biror kasallik bahonasida varaqa ochib berishini so‘radim. Vaholangki, o‘zim soppa-sog‘
edim. Shifokor ham hech kim tekshirmaydigan kasallik deb bavosil «tashxis»i bilan kasallik
varaqasi yozib berdi.
Ishim bitganidan xursand bo‘lib ko‘chaga chiqdim va shifoxona darvozasi yonida bir
tanishimni uchratdim. U mototsiklida meni ham olib ketadigan bo‘ldi. Rahmat aytib, orqaga
mingashdim va yo‘lni tekshirganimdan so‘ng yurishi mumkinligini, avtomashina yo‘qligini
aytdim. Endigina qo‘zg‘algandik hamki, orqadan katta tezlikda kelayotgan mashina mototsiklni
urib yubordi. Bu holat juda tez ro‘y berdi. Men yo‘lning narigi tomoniga uchib tushdim.
Ajablanarlisi, mototsikl haydovchisiga, ya’ni tanishimga hech narsa qilmagandi. Mening esa
oyog‘im singandi. Keyin singan oyog‘im tufayli bir oy shifoxonada yotib qoldim. Qarangki,
oyog‘im tuzalganidan so‘ng bavosil kasalligini orttirdim. Bir joyda uzoq qolganimning ta’siri
edi bu. Shu xastalik tufayli yana ikki oy ishga chiqolmadim. Ishdan biroz hordiq olishni niyat
qilgandim, ortig‘i bilan dam ham oldim va yolg‘on kasallikka rozi bo‘lgandim qimmatga
tushdi...

EXTRAMARITAL RELATIONSHIPS
Abstract This article analyzes the phenomenon of extramarital relationships from a
socio-psychological perspective. It explores the causes, consequences, and preventive
approaches to infidelity based on marital fidelity, psychological connections between spouses,
personal needs, and social factors. The influence of information technologies, shifts in gender
roles, and the rise of individualism in modern society are identified as significant contributors
to the increase in such relationships. The article proposes a theoretical and empirically grounded
approach based on surveys and existing scientific literature.

Отдельное внимание уделено влиянию информационных технологий, изменениям
гендерных ролей и усилению индивидуализма в современном обществе как важным
причинам роста подобных отношений. В статье предложен теоретический и эмпирически
обоснованный подход на основе опросов и анализа существующей научной литературы.
Ключевые слова: брак, измена, психологические потребности, верность,
социальные нормы, гендерные отношения
Kirish
Nikoh insoniyat tarixida eng qadimiy va barqaror ijtimoiy institutlardan biri sifatida
shakllangan. U nafaqat erkak va ayol o‘rtasidagi huquqiy va shaxsiy bog‘liqlikni ifodalaydi,
balki jamiyatning ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy barqarorligi, madaniy qadriyatlari va psixologik
sog‘lomligining poydevori sifatida ham e’tirof etiladi. Nikoh orqali shakllangan oila modeli
insonlar o‘rtasidagi o‘zaro hurmat, ishonch, sodiqlik, mehr-muhabbat va mas’uliyat kabi asosiy
tamoyillarni rivojlantiradi. Bu tamoyillar o‘z navbatida farzandlar tarbiyasi, iqtisodiy
barqarorlik va madaniy uzluksizlikni ta’minlashda muhim rol o‘ynaydi.
Biroq, zamonaviy globalizatsiya, texnologik taraqqiyot, axborot oqimi, mehnat
migratsiyasi va gender rollarining o‘zgarishi kabi omillar natijasida nikoh institutiga bo‘lgan
yondashuv ham sezilarli darajada o‘zgarib bormoqda. Ayniqsa, individualizmning kuchayishi,
shaxsiy ehtiyoj va erkinlikka intilishlar, mass-media va ijtimoiy tarmoqlarning ta’siri natijasida
nikoh institutiga xos bo‘lgan qadriyatlar tobora ko‘proq sinovdan o‘tmoqda. Zamonaviy
jamiyatda nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar, ya’ni xiyonat holatlari ko‘payib borayotgani ko‘plab
psixologik va ijtimoiy muammolarga sabab bo‘lmoqda. Bunday munosabatlar ko‘pincha
shaxslar o‘rtasidagi ishonchni yemiradi, oilaviy muhitni beqarorlashtiradi, ruhiy zo‘riqish va
hissiy tushkunliklarga olib keladi. Xiyonat hodisasi faqat individual darajada emas, balki
kengroq ijtimoiy va madaniy kontekstda ham ko‘rib chiqilishi zarur.
Ushbu maqola nikohdan tashqari munosabatlarning sabablari, oqibatlari va ularning
inson psixologiyasi hamda jamiyatdagi ijtimoiy munosabatlarga qanday ta’sir ko‘rsatishini
chuqur o‘rganishga qaratilgan. Maqolada shuningdek, xiyonat fenomenini oldini olish, oilaviy
barqarorlikni ta’minlash va sog‘lom munosabatlarni shakllantirishga qaratilgan profilaktik
yondashuvlar ham tahlil qilinadi.
Tadqiqot olib borgan olimlar:
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar va oila institutiga ta’siri haqida chet el olimlaridan biri
bo‘lgan Erving Goffmanning (1959) ijtimoiy psixologiya sohasidagi ishlari muhim o‘rin tutadi.
U “impression management” (ta’sir boshqaruvi) nazariyasini ishlab chiqqan bo‘lib, bu nazariya
odamlarning ijtimoiy munosabatlarida o‘zlarini qanday ko‘rsatishlari, boshqalar tomonidan
qanday baholanishlarini qanday boshqarishlari haqida gapiradi. Goffmanning fikriga ko‘ra, oila
institutida, shuningdek, nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar mavjud bo‘lishi, shaxsning ijtimoiy
rollarini va ta’sirini qanday boshqarishini, shuningdek, oilaviy imidjni qanday yaratishni va
saqlashni o‘zgartiradi.
168

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Goffmanning nuqtai nazaridan, nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar “impression
management” jarayonini sezilarli darajada murakkablashtiradi. Bunday munosabatlar oiladagi
shaxslarning haqiqiy roli va kimligini buzishga olib kelishi mumkin, bu esa oila a’zolari
o‘rtasidagi ishonchni pasaytiradi. Goffman, shuningdek, oilaviy rollarda yuzaga kelgan
noaniqliklarning shaxslararo aloqalarga salbiy ta’sirini ta’kidladi. Nikohdan tashqari
munosabatlar shaxslar orasidagi o‘zaro hurmatni, ishonchni va ehtiyotkorlikni yo‘qotishiga olib
keladi, natijada oilaning barqarorligi xavf ostiga tushadi.
O‘zbek olimlaridan Abdusamatov Xasanboy Usmonjon o‘g‘li tomonidan o‘rganilgan
tadqiqotlar oila institutining barqarorligi va uning jamiyatdagi roli haqida qimmatli nuqtai
nazarlarni taklif etadi. U o‘zining ilmiy ishlarida oila institutining mustahkamligi uchun axloqiy
va psixologik asoslarning ahamiyatini alohida ta’kidlagan. Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar
jamiyatning ijtimoiy-psixologik tuzilmasini buzishi mumkinligi haqida o‘z fikrlarini bildirgan.
Xusanboy Usmonjon o‘g‘lining fikriga ko‘ra, nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar oila ichidagi
ishonchni yo‘qotishga, psixologik tushkunlikka va hissiy bo‘shliqning yuzaga kelishiga olib
kelishi mumkin. Bunday holatlar oila a’zolari orasidagi o‘zaro hurmatni pasaytiradi va o‘zaro
aloqalarni buzadi.
Usmonjon o‘g‘li shuningdek, oila institutiga bo‘lgan hurmat va ishonchni saqlab qolish
uchun axloqiy qadriyatlar va psixologik barqarorlikni mustahkamlash zarurligini ta’kidlagan.
Uning fikriga ko‘ra, nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar oilaviy ahvolni beqarorlashtiradi va o‘zo‘zini anglash jarayonida ham salbiy o‘zgarishlarga olib keladi. Shu sababli, oila institutiga
nikohdan tashqari munosabatlarning salbiy ta’sirini kamaytirish va uning psixologik va ijtimoiy
barqarorligini saqlash uchun ta’lim va tarbiyaning ahamiyati katta.
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlarning sabablari
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar (xiyonat) oddiy shaxsiy qaror emas, balki psixologik va
sotsial omillarning murakkab o‘zaro ta’siriga asoslangan murakkab ijtimoiy-psixologik
hodisadir. Bu bo‘limda ushbu munosabatlarning psixologik va sotsial ildizlariga chuqur
yondashiladi.
Psixologik sabablari
Emotsional beqarorlik va e’tiborsizlik – Nikohda insonlar faqat jismoniy yaqinlikka
emas, balki emotsional qo‘llab-quvvatlash, tushunilish va qadrlanishga muhtoj bo‘ladi. Agar bu
ehtiyojlar yetarlicha qondirilmasa, shaxs o‘zini yolg‘iz, beqadr va befarq his qiladi. Aynan mana
shu emotsional ochlik, ayrim hollarda, insonni nikohdan tashqari emotsional yoki romantik
aloqalar izlashga undaydi.
Romantik ehtiyojlarning qondirilmasligi – Inson tabiatan sevish va sevilishga intiladi.
Nikohdagi romantik aloqaning so‘nishi, shaxslar o‘rtasidagi hissiy va jismoniy yaqinlikning
pasayishi, o‘zaro zavqning yo‘qolishi – bularning barchasi xiyonat uchun psixologik poydevor
yaratadi. Bunday holatda, nikohdagi shaxslar o‘zlarining hissiy bo‘shliqlarini boshqa insonlar
orqali to‘ldirishga harakat qilishi mumkin.

Shaxsiy qadriyatlar va o‘ziga past baho – O‘ziga ishonchning pastligi, shaxsiy
ehtiyojlarning anglanmasligi va o‘zini oqlash mexanizmlarining yetishmasligi xiyonatning
psixologik sabablari qatoriga kiradi. Ba’zida odamlar tashqi tasdiqqa, ya’ni o‘zini qadrli his
qilish uchun boshqalarning e’tiboriga ehtiyoj sezadi. Shu bilan birga, oilaviy hayotdan
charchagan yoki o‘zini qadrsiz his qilayotgan shaxslar bu ehtiyojni nikohdan tashqari aloqalarda
qondirishga harakat qilishadi.
Sotsial sabablari
Jamiyatda xiyonatga nisbatan toqatsiz munosabatning yo‘qligi – Ba’zi jamiyatlarda
xiyonat jiddiy ijtimoiy muammo sifatida emas, balki shaxsiy tanlov sifatida qaraladi. Bu holat
ayniqsa zamonaviy va liberal qarashlar keng tarqalgan muhitlarda uchraydi. Xiyonat uchun
ijtimoiy jazolarning yoki ijtimoiy bosimning kuchsizligi ushbu hodisaning normalashuviga olib
keladi.
Mass-media va internetdagi erkinlik – Bugungi kunda seriallar, filmlar va reklamalarda
xiyonat ko‘pincha romantik yoki qiziqarli sarguzasht sifatida aks ettiriladi. Ijtimoiy tarmoqlar,
tanishuv ilovalari (masalan, Tinder, Badoo va hokazo) esa odamlar orasidagi oson va tez aloqa
imkoniyatini yaratib, ehtiros va hayajonni oson izlashga sharoit yaratadi. Bu esa nikohdagi
sodiqlik tamoyillariga putur yetkazadi.
G‘arb madaniyatining ta’siri – G‘arbda shaxsiy erkinlik, individualizm va jinsiy ozodlik
qadriyatlari kuchli. Bu qadriyatlarning ommaviy axborot vositalari orqali boshqa jamiyatlarga
kirib borishi, xususan an’anaviy oila qadriyatlarini zaiflashtirishi mumkin. Natijada, ayrim
shaxslar o‘z ehtiyojlarini cheklashni emas, balki ular bilan yashashni afzal ko‘radilar.
Mobil ilovalar orqali oson tanishuv – Zamonaviy tanishuv texnologiyalari,
geolokatsiyaga asoslangan ilovalar va anonim muloqot platformalari odamlar orasidagi
masofani yo‘q qiladi. Bu imkoniyatlar ayrim hollarda odamlarni o‘zlari uchun qulayroq,
xavfsizroq deb hisoblagan yashirin munosabatlarga yo‘naltiradi. Ayniqsa, nikohdagi
muammolarni hal qilish o‘rniga yangi his-tuyg‘ular izlash istagi kuchayadi.
Psixologik oqibatlar
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar (xiyonat) inson psixologiyasiga chuqur va ko‘p qirrali
salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Bu jarayonda zarar ko‘ruvchi nafaqat xiyonatga uchragan tomon, balki
ko‘pincha xiyonat qilgan shaxsning o‘zi, farzandlar va hatto yaqin ijtimoiy muhit ham bo‘ladi.
Psixologik oqibatlar shaxsiy ruhiy holatdan boshlab, oilaviy va ijtimoiy tizimga qadar keng
doirada namoyon bo‘ladi.
Ishonchning buzilishi va ruhiy jarohatlar
Xiyonat eng avvalo ishonchni yemiradi — bu esa sog‘lom munosabatlarning tayanchi
hisoblanadi. Xiyonatga uchragan shaxs turmush o‘rtog‘i tomonidan xiyonat qilinishi natijasida
o‘zini aldanilgan, kamsitilgan va rad etilgan his qiladi. Bu holat ruhiy og‘riq, ichki ziddiyat va
o‘zaro munosabatlarga bo‘lgan ishonchni butunlay yo‘q qilishi mumkin. Xiyonat travmasi
ayrim hollarda post-travmatik stress buzilishiga (PTSB) olib kelishi ham mumkin.
O‘z-o‘zini qadrlash darajasining pasayishi
170

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Xiyonatdan keyin odamlar ko‘pincha o‘zini aybdor his qiladilar, o‘zlarini yetarli
emasdek, yoqimsiz, arzimas inson sifatida baholashadi. Bu esa o‘ziga bo‘lgan ishonchni
yo‘qotish, o‘zini qadrsizlash va o‘z-o‘zini tanqid qilish holatlariga olib keladi. O‘zini qadrlash
darajasining pasayishi uzoq muddatli ruhiy muammolar, ya’ni o‘zini izolyatsiya qilish, ijtimoiy
chekinish va hatto o‘z joniga qasd qilish xavfini oshiradi.
Depressiya, tashvish va tajanglik
Xiyonat bilan bog‘liq jarohatlar odatda depressiya, xavotir (anksiyete) va doimiy stress
holatlari bilan kechadi. Ayrim hollarda jismoniy simptomlar ham (uyqusizlik, ishtahaning
yo‘qolishi, yurak urishidagi o‘zgarishlar) namoyon bo‘ladi. Xiyonatga uchragan shaxslar
ko‘pincha qayta-qayta o‘sha hodisani yodga olishadi, bu esa fikrlarda va his-tuyg‘ularda
tiqilinch (obsessiv) holatlar paydo bo‘lishiga sabab bo‘ladi.
Shuningdek, xiyonatning aniqlanishi ko‘plab holatlarda o‘zaro janjallar, tajovuzkorlik,
ishonchsizlik va psixologik zo‘ravonlik kabi holatlarning yuzaga chiqishiga sabab bo‘ladi. Bu
esa nafaqat ikki inson, balki butun oila muhitini salbiy o‘zgartiradi.
Farzandlarga psixologik salbiy ta’sir
Xiyonat faqat turmush o‘rtoqlar o‘rtasidagi muammo emas — u bolalar hayotiga ham
chuqur ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Ota-onasi o‘rtasidagi ishonchsizlik, janjallar va ajrimlar farzandlarda
xavotir, ruhiy iztirob, o‘ziga ishonchning yo‘qolishi va agressiv xulq shakllanishiga sabab
bo‘ladi. Farzandlar ko‘pincha o‘zlarini aybdor his qilishadi yoki sevgiga bo‘lgan ishonchlarini
yo‘qotadilar. Bu holat ularning kelajakdagi munosabatlariga ham salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Bundan tashqari, farzandlar orasida psixosomatik kasalliklar, ijtimoiy moslashuvda
qiyinchilik, tahsilga qiziqishning pasayishi va introvert xatti-harakatlar ortishi holatlari
kuzatiladi. Bolalik davrida kuzatilgan bunday muammolar esa balog‘at yoshida jiddiy ruhiy
muammolarni keltirib chiqarishi mumkin.3. Gender jihatlari Ayollar va erkaklar orasida xiyonat
sabablari farq qilishi mumkin. Tadqiqotlarga ko‘ra, erkaklarda jismoniy yoki jinsiy ehtiyojlar
ustun tursa, ayollarda emotsional beqarorlik asosiy omil bo‘lishi mumkin. Biroq bu holat har
doim ham aniq chegaralangan emas va individual farqlarga bog‘liq.
Madaniy va diniy ta’sir
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlarga (xiyonatga) jamiyatlardagi munosabat ko‘p jihatdan
madaniy qadriyatlar va dini e’tiqodlar bilan belgilanadi. Har bir jamiyat o‘zining tarixiy
rivojlanishi, diniy asoslari, axloqiy me’yorlari hamda jinsiy rollarga nisbatan qarashlariga
asoslangan holda xiyonatni har xil darajada baholaydi. Shu sababli, xiyonatni ijtimoiy hodisa
sifatida to‘liq tushunish uchun uni madaniy va dini kontekstda ko‘rib chiqish muhimdir.
Madaniy ta’sirlar
Madaniyat inson xulq-atvorining ko‘plab jabhalarini, shu jumladan nikohdagi sodiqlik
me’yorlarini shakllantiradi. An’anaviy jamiyatlarda nikoh muqaddas institut sifatida qabul
qilinadi va nikohga sodiqlik yuqori qadriyat sifatida ulug‘lanadi. Bu kabi jamiyatlarda xiyonat
shunchaki axloqiy buzilish emas, balki ijtimoiy uyatsizlik, hatto ijtimoiy izolyatsiyaga olib
keladigan og‘ir jinoyat sifatida baholanadi. Aksincha, zamonaviy va individualistik
171

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

madaniyatlarda shaxsiy erkinlik, jinsiy mustaqillik va o‘z ehtiyojlarini ochiq ifoda etish kabi
qadriyatlar ustuvor bo‘lib, bu holatlarda xiyonat ba’zida “shaxsiy tanlov” yoki “emotsional
muvozanat izlash” sifatida baholanishi mumkin. Ayniqsa, G‘arb davlatlarida ayrim guruhlar
orasida ochiq munosabatlar (open relationship), ko‘p tomonlama sevgi (polyamory) kabi
alternativ nikoh shakllari normal hol sifatida ko‘riladi. Shu bilan birga, madaniyatlar o‘rtasidagi
global ta’sirlar, ommaviy madaniyat va mass-media vositalari xiyonatga nisbatan murosasizlik
darajasini pasaytirishga xizmat qilmoqda. Seriallar, filmlar, musiqalar va ijtimoiy tarmoqlar
orqali xiyonat va ehtirosli munosabatlar go‘yoki tabiiy hol sifatida ko‘rsatiladi, bu esa yosh
avlod ongi va munosabatlar madaniyatiga salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Diniy ta’sirlar
Diniy e’tiqodlar, ayniqsa monoteistik dinlar (Islom, Xristianlik, Yahudiylik) nikohga
bo‘lgan sadoqatni yuksak axloqiy va ilohiy buyruq sifatida talqin qiladi. Diniy jamiyatlarda
xiyonat nafaqat axloqiy buzilish, balki ilohiy qonunlarni buzish sifatida baholanadi. Bu esa
kishilarni xiyonatdan tiyilishga, o‘z nafsini nazorat qilishga undaydi.
Islom dinida nikoh muqaddas ahd sifatida e’tirof etiladi va xiyonat og‘ir gunoh sanaladi.
Qur’oni Karimda zinokorlik (nikohdan tashqari jinsiy aloqa) katta jinoyat sifatida qayd etilgan
va undan saqlanish insonlarning fazilati deb ta’riflangan. Hadislarda esa er-xotin o‘rtasidagi
sodiqlik, halollik va ishonch oilaning barqarorligi uchun asosiy omillar sifatida ko‘rsatib
o‘tilgan. Islom huquqida xiyonat ajrashish uchun asos bo‘lib xizmat qilishi mumkin, bu esa
diniy me’yorlar ta’sirida jamiyatda bu holatga nisbatan keskin munosabat shakllanishiga olib
keladi.
Xristianlikda, ayniqsa Katolik va Pravoslav an’analarida nikoh “muqaddas ahd”
hisoblanadi va xiyonat (adultery) eng og‘ir gunohlardan biri sifatida qaraladi. Injilda sodiqlik
va mehr-muhabbat nikohning asosi sifatida e’tirof etiladi.
Diniy qadriyatlar bilan yo‘g‘rilgan jamiyatlarda xiyonatga nisbatan keskin ijtimoiy
reaktsiya kuzatiladi — bunday shaxslar ko‘pincha jamoada ayblanadi, obro‘sini yo‘qotadi va
ijtimoiy izolyatsiyaga uchrashi mumkin. Bu esa xiyonatning kamayishiga yoki yashirin shaklda
sodir etilishiga olib keladi.
Raqamli davr va axborot texnologiyalarining roli
Axborot-kommunikatsiya texnologiyalarining jadal rivojlanishi insonlar orasidagi
muloqot shaklini tubdan o‘zgartirdi. Mobil qurilmalar, ijtimoiy tarmoqlar, tanishuv ilovalari va
boshqa onlayn platformalar orqali odamlar bir-biri bilan tez, erkin va yashirin ravishda
bog‘lanish imkoniga ega bo‘ldilar. Bu esa nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar sonining oshishiga
sabab bo‘layotgan muhim omillardan biri sifatida ko‘rilmoqda.
Mobil telefonlar va messenjyerlar (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal va h.k.) orqali xabar
almashish, ovozli yoki videoqo‘ng‘iroqlar qilish hamda multimedialar yuborish imkoniyatlari
shaxslar o‘rtasidagi yashirin munosabatlarni davom ettirishni osonlashtiradi. Maxfiy chatlar,
shifrlangan suhbatlar yoki kontaktlarni yashirish kabi funksiyalar xiyonatni aniqlashni
qiyinlashtiradi.
172

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Ijtimoiy tarmoqlar (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok va h.k.) esa yangi tanishuvlar, flört va
emotsional aloqalar o‘rnatish uchun qulay platforma bo‘lib xizmat qiladi. Profil suratlari,
hikoyalar, “like” va “kommentariyalar” orqali insonlar bir-birlariga bevosita yoki bilvosita
hissiy signallar yuborishadi. Bu esa mavjud munosabatlarga xavf tug‘diruvchi tashqi faktorga
aylanishi mumkin. Tanishuv ilovalari (masalan, Tinder, Bumble, Badoo) orqali odamlar bir
necha daqiqa ichida turli insonlar bilan aloqa o‘rnatishi mumkin. Bu jarayonda real hayotdagi
sadoqat hissi va axloqiy cheklovlar zaiflashadi.
Shuningdek, raqamli anonimlik va shaxsni yashirish imkoniyati orqali shaxslar
o‘zlarining yashirin ehtiyojlarini internet orqali qondirishga urinadilar. Bu esa an’anaviy
sodiqlik tushunchasining zaiflashuviga olib keladi. Raqamli vositalar orqali yuzaga kelgan
“raqamli xiyonat” (emotional cheating) holatlari ko‘payib bormoqda. Bu xatti-harakatlar
jismoniy aloqalardan ko‘ra sezilarsiz, lekin psixologik jihatdan kuchliroq bo‘lishi mumkin.
Uzoq suhbatlar, hissiy bog‘lanishlar, romantik xabarlar yoki yashirin onlayn munosabatlar ham
ishonchni buzuvchi asosiy omillardan biridir.
Profilaktik yondashuvlar
Nikohdagi sodiqlikni saqlab qolish va xiyonatning oldini olish uchun faqat jazolovchi
yoki ayblovchi yondashuvlar yetarli emas. Bunday holatlarning ildiziga qarshi samarali
kurashish uchun kompleks, oldini oluvchi (profilaktik) yondashuvlar zarur. Quyida shunday
asosiy yo‘nalishlar bayon etiladi:
Ochiq va sog‘lom kommunikatsiya
Har qanday barqaror nikohning asosi – bu ochiq, samimiy va doimiy muloqotdir. Erxotinlar o‘z his-tuyg‘ularini, ehtiyojlarini, noroziliklarini yoki istaklarini ochiq ifoda eta
olishlari kerak. E’tiborsizlik, tushunmovchilik yoki shubhalar paydo bo‘lganda ularni hal
qilishning eng samarali yo‘li – bu muloyim muloqotdir. Kommunikatsiyaning yo‘qligi yoki
noto‘g‘ri shakli ko‘pincha xiyonatga yo‘l ochadi.
Emotsional yaqinlikni oshirish
Faqat jismoniy yaqinlik emas, balki ruhiy yaqinlik ham muhim ahamiyatga ega. Turmush
o‘rtog‘ining his-tuyg‘ularini anglash, bir-biriga vaqt ajratish, birgalikda zavqli mashg‘ulotlar
bilan shug‘ullanish va o‘zaro mehr-muhabbatni muntazam namoyon etish orqali emotsional
bog‘liqlik mustahkamlanadi. Bunday holatda tashqi hissiy aloqa izlash ehtiyoji kamayadi.
Nikoh oldi psixologik tayyorgarlik
Nikohga kirishishdan avval juftliklar psixologik tayyorgarlik ko‘rishlari, o‘zlarini va birbirlarini yaxshiroq tushunib olishlari lozim. Oila qurish haqidagi noto‘g‘ri tasavvurlar, haddan
ziyod idealizatsiya yoki reallikdan uzilgan umidlar keyinchalik norozilik va xiyonatga sabab
bo‘lishi mumkin. Psixologik tayyorgarlik jarayonida har ikki tomon o‘z majburiyatlari, roli va
kutilayotgan ehtiyojlar haqida ochiq gaplashishlari zarur.
Oila terapiyasi va maslahat xizmati
Agar nikohdagi muammolar chuqurlashgan bo‘lsa, psixologik maslahat yoki oila
terapiyasidan foydalanish samarali bo‘ladi. Tajribali mutaxassislar vositasida er-xotinlar o‘zaro
173

muammolarni ochib bera olishadi, bir-birlarini yaxshiroq anglaydilar va muammolar ustida
konstruktiv ishlashni o‘rganadilar. Bunday yondashuv ko‘plab oilalarni ajrimdan, farzandlarni
esa ruhiy iztirobdan saqlab qoladi.
Xulosa:
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar zamonaviy jamiyatda dolzarb masala bo’lib, ularning
insonlar psixologiyasi va ijtimoiy tuzilmalarga ta’siri tobora ortib bormoqda. Ushbu maqolada
ko’rib chiqilganidek, nikohdan tashqari aloqalar turli sabablarga ko’ra yuzaga keladi: ular
ba’zan shaxsiy ehtiyojlar, ba’zan esa turmush o’rtog’ining hissiy yoki jismoniy ehtiyojlarini
qondirish maqsadida shakllanadi. Bunday munosabatlar ko’pincha ishonch, o’zaro hurmat va
yashirin ehtiroslar ustidan qurilgan bo’lib, ularning ko’plab ijtimoiy, psixologik va etika bilan
bog’liq oqibatlari mavjud.
Nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar shaxslarning his-tuyg’ularini va xatti-harakatlarini
beqarorlashtirishi, ularni ruhiy va hissiy tushkunlikka olib kelishi mumkin. Shuningdek, bunday
munosabatlar oilaviy barqarorlikka zarar etkazishi, oilaviy aloqalar va jamiyatdagi axloqiy
qadriyatlar tizimiga salbiy ta’sir ko’rsatishi ehtimoli bor. Tadqiqotlar shuni ko’rsatadiki,
nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar ko’pincha ishonchni yo’qotish, stress, depressiya va hissiy
bo’shliqni keltirib chiqaradi, bu esa uzun muddatda psixologik salomatlikka salbiy ta’sir qiladi.
Shuningdek, nikohdan tashqari munosabatlarni o’rganish, shaxsiy va oilaviy
munosabatlarning tabiati, o’zaro bog’lanishlar, ijtimoiy va madaniy qadriyatlar tizimlarini
yaxshiroq tushunishga imkon beradi. Shuning uchun, bu masalani chuqur tahlil qilish, jamiyatda
oilaviy va shaxsiy munosabatlarga bo’lgan qarashlarni yangilashni talab etadi. Nikohdan
tashqari munosabatlar nafaqat shaxsiy, balki ijtimoiy darajada ham kengroq qarashlarni va ilgari
surishni talab qiladi.
Shunday qilib, nikohdan tashqari munosabatlar mavzusida yanada kengroq ilmiy
izlanishlar olib borish, ijtimoiy va psixologik jihatlarini yaxshiroq tushunish jamiyatda oilaviy
barqarorlik, ishonch va o’zaro hurmatni mustahkamlashga xizmat qilishi mumkin.

ANNOTATSIYA, azkur maqolada shaxsning ijtimoiy maqomi shakllanishi va kasbiy
sulolaning yuzaga kelishida psixologik omillarning roli o‘rganilgan. Oila muhitining,
motivatsiyaning, shaxsiy xususiyatlarning va ijtimoiy-madaniy omillarning ushbu
jarayonlardagi ta’siri tahlil qilingan. Tadqiqot natijalari, kasbiy yo‘nalishning avloddan-avlodga
o‘tishi va ijtimoiy maqomning mustahkamlanishida psixologik mexanizmlar muhim
ahamiyatga ega ekanligini ko‘rsatadi.
Kalit so‘zlar: kasbiy sulola, ijtimoiy maqom, kasb tanlash, kasbiy motivatsiya,
psixologik omillar, shaxsni ijtimoiylashtirish.
KIRISH
Shaxsning jamiyatdagi o‘rni va ijtimoiy mavqei uning ijtimoiy maqomini belgilaydi.
Ijtimoiy maqom — bu jamiyat tomonidan tan olinadigan va qadrlanadigan rol yoki pozitsiyadir.
O‘z navbatida, kasbiy sulola — bu bir necha avlod davomida o‘xshash kasblarni tanlash orqali
vujudga keladigan kasbiy an’anadir. Bu jarayonlar nafaqat ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy omillar, balki
chuqur psixologik mexanizmlar orqali shakllanadi. Ushbu maqolada ana shu psixologik
omillarni aniqlash va ularning ijtimoiy maqom hamda kasbiy sulolalarning shakllanishidagi
rolini yoritish maqsad qilingan. Shахs kun dаvоmidа turli хil оdаmlаr vа (уоki) ijtimоiу

nafaqat individual imkoniyat va qiziqishlarga, balki ijtimoiy muhit, oilaviy qadriyatlar, kasbiy
sulola va psixologik omillarga ham bog‘liqdir. Bugungi kunda ota-onaning kasbiy faoliyati
farzandning kasbga bo‘lgan munosabati, intilishi va motivatsiyasiga bevosita ta’sir
ko‘rsatmoqda. Ayniqsa, kasbiy sulola mavjud bo‘lgan oilalarda bu jarayon izchil va izchil

Mаsаlаn, ауоl hаm rаfiqа, hаm оnа, hаm ustоz mаvqеlаrini еgаllаshi mumkin. Hаr bir mаvqе
insоngа muаууаn tаlаblаrni qо‘уаdi vа, shu bilаn birgа, ungа bir qаnсhа huquqlаrni bеrаdi.

NATIJALAR
Tadqiqot natijalari quyidagicha umumlashtirildi: Ushbu tadqiqotda quyidagi
metodologik yondashuvlar asos qilib olindi:
• Nazariy tahlil: shaxs va kasbiy rivojlanishga oid ko’plab psixolog olimlarning ilmiy
qarashlari tahlil qilindi;
• Komparativ tahlil: kasbiy sulola mavjud oilalardagi farzandlar va kasbiy mustaqil
tanlov qilgan shaxslarning motivatsiya va kasbiy identifikatsiyasi o‘rtasidagi farqlar o‘rganildi;

• Sotsiologik kuzatuv: talabalar va yosh mutaxassislar o‘rtasida so‘rovnoma va suhbatlar
orqali kasb tanlashga ta’sir etuvchi omillar aniqlashtirildi.
XULOSA
Tadqiqotlardan kelib chiqib quyidagi xulosalarga kelindi:
• Kasb tanlashga ijtimoiy maqom, oilaviy muhit va kasbiy sulola katta ta’sir ko‘rsatadi;
• Kasbiy motivatsiya ota-onaning namunasiga asoslangan holda shakllanadi;
• Kasbiy sulolalarda farzandlar o‘zini kasbda topishda yuqori faollik, mas’uliyat va
barqarorlik ko‘rsatadi.
Prоfеssiоnаlizm muаууаn shахsning оilаviу shаjаrаsi dоirаsidа о‘rgаnilgаndа, insоnning
rivоjlаntirishi zаrur bо‘lgаn kuсhli tоmоnlаrini, sifаtlаrini уuzаgа сhiqаrishdа vа ishni еng
уахshi, sаmаrаli bаjаrish mumkin bо‘lgаn usullаrini аniqlаshdа уоrdаm bеrаdi.
Kаsbiу istiqbоlgа intilish vа kаsb tаnlаshgа хауriхоhlik mоtivlаrigа nisbаtаn shахsiу
bоg‘liqlik, оdаtdа, оilаviу mеrоsgа еgа bо‘lgаn kаsbiу sulоlа vаkili о‘zigа ishоngаn hоldа
hаmkаsblаri bilаn bо‘lаdigаn munоsаbаtdаn qоniqish hоsil qilаdi vа tаnlаgаn fаоliуаtidа о‘zini
еrkin his qilаdi. Bu vоris аvlоd iсhki intilishining уаqqоl nаmоуоn bо‘lish imkоniуаtini
оshirаdi.
Keyingi tadqiqotlarmizda maktab davridan boshlab kasbiy yo‘naltirish dasturlarida
oilaviy kasb an’analariga asoslangan treninglar tashkil etish; kasbiy mukammallikni
shakllantirishga qaratilgan psixologik dasturlarni ishlab chiqishni o’z oldimizga maqsad qilib

vujudga kelishi uni bartaraf etish, mazkur vaziyatlarning psixoprofilaktikasi va
psixokorrektsion texnologiyalarini ishlab chiqish zaruratini keltirib chiqaradi.
Agar biror shaxs yoki bir necha individlar har qanday ijtimoiy guruhda muammoli
qarama-qarshi vaziyatga ega bo'lsa yoki bir ijtimoiy guruh boshqa ijtimoiy guruh bilan
muammoli vaziyatga ega bo'lsa, biz konfliktning paydo bo'lishi haqida gapirishimiz mumkin.
Bunda ana shu qarama-qarshiliklarni bartaraf etish, ya’ni ziddiyatni bartaraf etish zarurati
tug‘ilishi aniq. Demak, konfliktning har bir ishtirokchisi xulq-atvor modelini (strategiyasini)
tanlash masalasiga duch keladi.
Asosiy qism. Dastlab, “nizo” tushunchasini mazmun-mohiyatini ochishga harakat qilib
koʼraylik. O‘zbek tilining izohli lug‘atida “nizo” so‘zi “kelishmovchilik, tortishuv, fikrlar
to‘qnashuvi” deb ta’riflangan. Ushbu ta'rif maktablardagi nizolar uchun ham to'liq mos keladi.

Ta'lim jarayoni ishtirokchilari: o‘quvchilar, ularning ota-onalari, o'qituvchilar va ma'muriyat
ham turli kelishmovchiliklarga duch kelishadi. Tajribali o'qituvchilar o'quv jarayonidagi
muammoli vaziyatlar muqarrar ekanligini ta’kidlashadi, chunki o'quv jarayonining har bir
ishtirokchisi o'z manfaatlariga va maqbul hamda to'g'ri bo'lgan hodisalar haqida o'z g'oyalariga
ega. Asosiysi, ziddiyatdan qochishga harakat qilish emas, balki uni hal qilishning konstruktiv
usullarini topishdir. Sof shaklda konfliktga ijobiy yoki salbiy baho berish mumkin emas;
qarama-qarshilik natijasi bilan belgilanadi. Agar barcha munozaralar va munozaralardan so'ng,
raqiblar bir-birining nuqtai nazarini tushunib, murosali yechim topsa va o'zaro ta'sirning yangi
shakllarini qabul qila olsa, unda bunday ziddiyatni konstruktiv deb hisoblash mumkin. Agar bu
sodir bo'lmasa va tomonlar norozi bo'lib qolsa, munosabatlar yanada muammoli bo'lib qolsa
yoki to'xtasa, bunday nizo halokatli hisoblanadi.
Zamonaviy konfliktologiya nizoli vaziyatda shaxsning (yoki guruhning) mumkin bo'lgan
xatti-harakatlarining beshta strategiyasini aniqlaydi va unga javob berishning odatiy usullarini
belgilaydi. Respondentning guruhda, jamoada raqobat va hamkorlikka qanchalik moyilligini, u
qanchalik murosaga intilishini, nizolardan qochishini yoki aksincha, ularni kuchaytirishga
harakat qilishini aniqlash mumkin. Ushbu uslub, shuningdek, har bir jamoa a'zosining
birgalikdagi faoliyatga moslashish darajasini baholashga imkon beradi.
Hamkorlik - bu boshqa tomonning manfaatlarini ham, shaxslararo munosabatlarning
qiymatini ham hisobga olgan holda nizoni hal qilishga urinishdir. Ushbu strategiyaga rioya
qilgan holda, odam nizoni hal qilishda faol ishtirok etadi va o'z manfaatlarini himoya qiladi, shu
bilan birga boshqa shaxs bilan hamkorlik qilishga harakat qiladi. Ushbu uslub nizolarni hal
qilishning boshqa ko'plab yondashuvlariga qaraganda vaqt o'tishi bilan ko'proq ishlashni talab
qiladi. Chunki tomonlar, birinchi navbatda, bir-birlarining ehtiyojlari, tashvishlari va
manfaatlarini aniqlashadi - “stolga qo'yishadi”, keyin ularni muhokama qilishadi. Ushbu uslub,
ayniqsa, tomonlar turli xil yashirin ehtiyojlarga ega bo'lganda samarali bo'ladi. Bunday hollarda
norozilik manbasini aniqlash qiyin bo'lishi mumkin. Avvaliga ikkalasi ham xuddi shu narsani
xohlayotgandek yoki uzoq kelajak uchun qarama-qarshi maqsadlarga ega bo'lib tuyulishi
mumkin, bu to'qnashuvning bevosita manbai hisoblanadi. Biroq, nizodagi tashqi bayonotlar
yoki pozitsiyalar bilan ziddiyatli vaziyatning haqiqiy sabablari bo'lib xizmat qiladigan asosiy
manfaatlar yoki ehtiyojlar o'rtasida farqlar mavjud. Konfliktni hal qilishda ushbu uslub umumiy,
murosasiz yechim topish zarur bo'lganda qo'llaniladi; boshqa tomon bilan uzoq muddatli,
mustahkam munosabatlarni saqlab qolish; o'zaro hamkorlikning maqsadi - birgalikdagi
faoliyatda tajriba orttirish; tomonlar bir-birining fikrini tinglashni va hurmat qilishni biladi;
jamoaning birgalikdagi faoliyati mavzusi bo'yicha umumiy nuqtai nazarlarni topish kerak.
Hamkorlik nizolarni konstruktiv hal etishning cho'qqisidir.
Raqobat - bu har ikki tomon uchun muhim bo'lgan qimmatli narsa uchun kurashda bir
qarama-qarshi tomon va boshqasi o'rtasidagi faol qarama-qarshilik. Raqobat uslubini
qo'llagan kishi juda faol va nizolarni o'ziga xos tarzda hal qilishni afzal ko'radi. U boshqa
odamlar bilan hamkorlik qilishdan manfaatdor emas va irodali qarorlar qabul qilishga qodir. K.

Tomas va R. Kilmanning fikricha, shaxs bu uslubni konfliktli o‘zaro ta’sirning maqsadi qaramaqarshi tomonning manfaatlariga zarar yetkazadigan holda o‘z manfaatlarini qondirish bo‘lgan
hollarda foydalanadi. Maqsadiga erishish uchun u o'z irodasini ishga soladi. Ushbu strategiya
konfliktning natijasi tomonlardan biri uchun juda muhim bo'lgan va konflikt ishtirokchisi uni
o'z foydasiga hal qilishga intilganda qo'llaniladi; shaxs yetarli kuch va vakolatga ega (hokimiyat
fikriga bo'ysunish); bu vaziyatdan boshqa yo'l yo'q bo'lganda.
Murosaga kelish - bu har ikki tomonni ham qoniqtiradigan nizoli vaziyatning birgalikda
topilgan yechimi. Ushbu uslub o'zaro murosali yechimni ishlab chiqish uchun o'zaro imtiyozlar
bilan tavsiflanadi. Natijada, har ikki tomonning ehtiyojlari qisman qondiriladi. Bunday xattiharakatlar har ikki tomon ham bir xil darajada jiddiy dalillarga ega bo'lganda va teng kuchga
ega bo'lganda qo'llaniladi; istakni qondirish konflikt mavzusi uchun katta ahamiyatga ega emas;
mojaro tomonlari hech bo'lmaganda vaqtinchalik yechimni qabul qilishlari kerak, chunki
boshqasini ishlab chiqish imkoniyati yo'q. Murosaga kelish, albatta, konstruktiv yo'ldir.
Moslashish - intilishlarni pasaytirish va raqib pozitsiyasini qabul qilish - bu murosa
siyosati, ya'ni sub'ekt o'z manfaatlarini boshqa tomon foydasiga qurbon qiladi, uning
manfaatlariga to'liq bo'ysunadi. K. Tomas va R. Kilmanning fikricha, ishning natijasi bir tomon
uchun nihoyatda muhim, ikkinchisi uchun ahamiyatsiz bo‘lsa, bu uslub eng samarali
hisoblanadi. Akkomodativ uslubdan asosiy maqsad ziddiyatni hal qilishdan ko'ra, xotirjamlik
va barqarorlikni tiklash bo'lganda foydalanish mumkin; kelishmovchilik predmeti
nizolashayotgan tomonlardan biri uchun muhim emas yoki nizolashayotgan tomon vaziyatni
hal qilish haqida qayg'urmasa; nizo tomonlari o'z nuqtai nazarini himoya qilishdan ko'ra, boshqa
odamlar bilan yaxshi, to'g'ri munosabatlarni saqlab qolishni xohlashadi; tomonlardan birida
g'alaba qozonish uchun yetarli imkoniyat yo'q.
Qochish - ziddiyatli vaziyatdan uzoqlashish. Bu uslub inson o'z manfaatlarini himoya
qilmasligida amalga oshiriladi; u eng yaxshi qo'shma yechimni ishlab chiqish uchun boshqa
tomon bilan hamkorlik qilishga tayyor emas va shuning uchun nizoni hal qilishdan qochadi. K.
Tomas fikricha “mojarodan qochib, hech bir tomon o'z maqsadiga erisha olmaydi”. Qochish
uslubi kelishmovchilik manbai konflikt predmeti uchun ahamiyatli bo'lmagan hollarda
qo'llaniladi; tomonlardan biri masalani o'z foydasiga hal qilishga tayyor emas; sub'ekt qaror
qabul qilishdan oldin vaziyatni tahlil qilish va qo'shimcha ma'lumot olish uchun vaqt topishi
kerak; muammoni hal qilish xavfli, chunki ziddiyatni ochiq muhokama qilish vaziyatni
yomonlashtirishi mumkin; ishtirokchilar mojaroni muvaffaqiyatli hal qila oladi; muammoni hal
qilish qo'shimcha muammolarni keltirib chiqarishi mumkin.
Xulosa. Konfliktologiya, yoki konfliktlar yechimi sohasi yangi rivojlanib kelayotgan va
taraqqiy etayotgan fan sohalaridan biri bo‘lib hisoblanadi. Shu bois, konfliktologiya sohasining
nazariy asoslari, uning milliy xususiyatlari, ijtimoiy o‘ziga xosliklari, konfliktlarning jamiyat
hayoti bilan aloqadorligi, shaxslararo konfliktlar, konfliktlarning huquqiy aspektlari, mehnat
jamoasidagi konfliktlar masalalari ko‘pchilik tadqiqotchilarni qiziqtiradi. Konfliktologik

Аннотaция: Статья посвящена психологические особенности самооценки в
эмоциональных отношениях супругов-мигрантов. В ней представлены результаты
исследований показывающие, что трудовая миграция вызывает социальнопсихологические и ценностные изменения у людей. В статье описаны проблемы
мигрантов, конфликты в семейных отношениях и приводит к возникновению у супругов,
в том числе и у супруга, который остается дома, ряда негативных эмоциональных
состояний: страха, тревоги, пренебрежения, агрессии, депрессии и неуверенности в себе.
Обычно мы рассматриваем отъезд одного из супругов из дома в связи с трудовой
миграцией как событие, которое в сочетании с длительной разлукой членов семьи друг с
другом вызывает семейный стресс.
Ключевые слова: миграция, семья мигрантов, социокультурная среда, адаптация,
фактор, женщина, мужчина, эмоциональные отношения, пары.
Annotatsiya:Ushbu maqola mehnat migratsiyasi sharoitida yashovchi turmush
o‘rtoqlarning emotsional munosabatlarida o‘z-o‘zini baholashning psixologik xususiyatlariga
bag‘ishlangan. Unda mehnat migratsiyasi inson hayotida ijtimoiy-psixologik va qadriyatga oid
o‘zgarishlarga sabab bo‘lishi haqidagi tadqiqot natijalari keltirilgan. Maqolada migrant
oilalardagi muammolar, oila ichidagi ziddiyatlar va mehnat migratsiyasi sabab uzoq vaqt ajralib
turish oqibatida ham uyda qolgan, ham chet elda ishlayotgan turmush o‘rtoqda paydo
bo‘ladigan salbiy emotsional holatlar: qo‘rquv, xavotir, e’tiborsizlik, tajovuzkorlik, tushkunlik
va o‘ziga ishonchsizlik holatlari tasvirlangan. Odatda, turmush o‘rtoqlardan birining mehnat
migratsiyasi sababli uyini tark etishi va uzoq muddat ajralib turish holati oila a’zolari orasida
oila stressiga olib keluvchi omil sifatida qaraladi.

Annotation: The article is devoted to the psychological features of self-esteem in
emotional relationships of migrant spouses. It presents the results of research showing that labor
migration causes socio-psychological and value changes in people. The article describes the
problems of migrants, conflicts in family relationships and leads to the emergence of a number
184

of negative emotional states in spouses, including the spouse who remains at home: fear,
anxiety, neglect, aggression, depression and self-doubt. We usually view the departure of one
of the spouses from home due to labor migration as an event that, combined with the long-term
separation of family members from each other, causes family stress.
Key words: migration, migrant family, socio-cultural environment, adaptation, factor,
woman, man, emotional relationships, couples.
Введение. В современном глобализованном мире вопросы миграции стали одной
из основных тем общественной повестки дня во всем мире. Главным важным аспектом
миграции является социально-психологическая адаптация мигрантов, поскольку
нерешенность психологических проблем адаптации, возникающих в процессе миграции,
может привести к возникновению множества проблемных ситуаций для самих
мигрантов, их семей и общества. Когда мигрант сталкивается с новой культурой и
средой, у него или у нее может возникнуть сложное и напряженное отношение к
ситуации, особенно если он только что прибыл в эту среду. Уровень стресса у мигрантов
высок, когда на первый план выходят различия в ценностях и религии, а когда различия
в традициях, обычаях и ценностях других стран значительны, это еще больше усложняет
их адаптацию и создает чувство неудовлетворенности. Тем не менее, мигранты, с одной
стороны, испытывают потребность в успешной социализации в новой среде. С другой
стороны, в процессе миграции они испытывают сильный эмоциональный стресс, и
потребность в психологической поддержке со стороны семьи выходит на первый план.
Подобные ситуации не могут не отразиться на эмоциональной сфере человека.
Изменения в эмоциональной сфере личности могут в определенной степени влиять и на
отношения с семьей.
Самое трудное, с чем часто сталкиваются мигранты, прибывая в другую страну —
это разлука с семьей и близкими. Чувство тоски по близким трудно чем-то другим
заполнить, что приводит к депрессии и потере уверенности в себе. Мигранты,
вынужденные покинуть свои семьи, как правило, против своей воли, но по
экономическим причинам, испытывают это чувство сильнее, а чувство долга в их жизни
может усилить их горе. Звонки по мобильному телефону или онлайн-общение с
близкими могут облегчить чувство тоски, но они не могут заменить ощущения от
прикосновения или вдыхания запаха любимых людей.
Все это может негативно сказаться на новых мигрантах и их семьях, вызывая
симптомы депрессии, тревоги, подавленности, беспокойства, стресса или других
проблем с психическим здоровьем. Если один из супругов в семье испытывает
психологические проблемы, его проблемы могут повлиять на всю семью.
Результати и обсуждение. Ниже мы представляем результаты нашего
исследования различий в эмоциональной самооценке супругов членами семей мигрантов
и немигрантов. Общая эмоциональная направленность человека позволяет ему, прежде
185

всего, выбирать сферу деятельности, соответствующую его ориентации. В результате
были обнаружены значимые и позитивные различия между эмоциями, объединяющими
эмоциональную сферу личности в семьях трудовых мигрантов и немигрантов.

Средний цветовой указатель семей немигрантов по шкале эмоций глорика составил
160,92, тогда как цветовой индекс семей мигрантов составил 141,41 (U=9854; p<0,05).
Эмоции играют ключевую роль в формировании, укреплении и эффективной
реализации моральных установок человека. В то время как основной целью трудовых
мигрантов, отправляющихся на работу в другую страну, является, в основном,
стремление к материальному успеху, успех членов семей, не являющихся мигрантами,
обусловлен их собственной потребностью в приобретении опыта работы и
профессиональном росте.
Праксические эмоции были в основном ориентированы на деятельность, со
средними значениями цвета 161,20 в семьях мигрантов и 140,46 в семьях немигрантов
(U=9761,5; p<0,05). Несмотря на активную деятельность трудовых мигрантов, сильную
волевую и эмоциональную напряженность в достижении целей, чрезмерную
мобилизацию физических и умственных способностей, удовлетворенность результатами
и производительностью труда вызывает у них приятное чувство выполненного долга. С
другой стороны, семьи, не являющиеся мигрантами, нуждаются в отдыхе и в большом
количестве движений.
Гностические эмоции составили 163,59 в семьях мигрантов и 137,99 в семьях
немигрантов (U=9396; p<0,05). В результате прибытия трудовых мигрантов в новую
страну у них возникает повышенный интерес к изучению культуры, языка, обычаев и
традиций этой страны, а также к получению информации о них. Гностические эмоции,
потребность в получении новой информации в дальнейшем облегчат их адаптацию в этой
стране и помогут им наладить общение с коренным населением.

Средние значения цвета эстетических эмоций составили 139,72 в семьях
немигрантов и 161,92 в семьях мигрантов (U=9652; p<0,05). В представлении мигрантов
эстетические чувства описывают потребность личности в гармонии с окружающей
средой, которая проявляется в соответствии человеческих и экологических измерений.

В следующей, отобранной нами выборке семей трудовых мигрантов общая
эмоциональная направленность личности характеризуется более высоким уровнем
коммуникативных эмоций у женщин (82,25). Низкий показатель данного показателя у
мужчин (66,96) отражает потребность в межличностном общении, особенно вследствие
незнания языка, необходимости учитывать права и интересы других при вступлении в
межличностные отношения в другой стране. Кроме того, их внимание в основном
сосредоточено на зарабатывании денег, и в силу потребности в деятельности у них
отсутствует потребность в общении. Изменения коммуникативных эмоций происходят в
результате усиления желания общаться с другими людьми, обмениваться идеями и
опытом, сопереживания, доброты, уважения к кому-либо и благодарности (U=2205;
p<0,05).
В глорических эмоциях среднее значение цвета у мужчин составило 90,67, а у
женщин — 65,77 (U=2205; p<0,01). Чем выше этот показатель у мужчин, тем больше у
них потребность преуспеть в финансовом плане, находясь в трудовой миграции вместе с
семьей и женой. Именно благодаря этому у человека, мигрирующего в результате
переезда в другую страну, усиливается желание найти свое место в новой среде и чувство
признания своей идентичности в чужой стране.

Когда мужчина уезжает на работу в другую страну, все обязанности по дому
ложатся на плечи женщины. Теперь, наряду с женскими обязанностями, у нее есть и
мужские обязанности. В связи с возросшей активностью женщин дома и на работе
основное внимание уделяется необходимости проявлять инициативу и достигать
результатов. Это также можно понять из показателей, представленных в таблице выше,
где этот результат составил 93,65 для женщин и 56,73 для мужчин (U=1499,5; p<0,001).
В романтических эмоциях мужчины также показали более высокий средний балл
по цвету (89,25), тогда как женщины показали более низкий средний балл по цвету
(56,73) (U=2052,5; p<0,01). Исходя из этого, женщины имели относительно более низкое
отношение к любви, чем мужчины. Именно потому, что мигранты находятся далеко друг
от друга, они чаще сталкиваются с различными проблемами, трудностями, взлетами и
падениями в жизни, что приводит к угасанию у них определенных чувств.
В характере женщины отчетливо прослеживается ее любовь к прекрасному, ее
чувства и переживания, возникающие на основе эстетического восприятия, а также
вдохновленные произведениями искусства и природой. Исходя из этого, мы видим, что
потребность в эстетических эмоциях у женщин высокая (85,03) (U=2223,5; p<0,05).
Высокий уровень активных эмоций у женщин (85,55) обусловлен одной из
особенностей, характерных для женщин в узбекских семьях, – стремлением с детства
собирать драгоценности из комода, интересом к коллекционированию золотых
украшений и различных видов цветов в доме, а также чувствами, связанными с
коллекционированием вещей, выходящих за рамки практических нужд (U=2179,5;
p<0,01).

супругами, их умению общаться друг с другом и чувству взаимного удовлетворения.
Психологическая совместимость в браке проявляется через радость, мир и гордость. Это
ключевой показатель стабильности и благополучия отношений в паре, который может

продолжительности семейной жизни в семьях трудовых мигрантов происходят
изменения в их романтических эмоциях. В частности, средний цветовой показатель в
семьях с период брака 1–5 лет составил 83,40, в семьях с период брака 6–10 лет – 84,45,
а в семьях с продолжительностью брака 11–15 лет – 63,48 (H=8,751; p<0,05).

На основе анализа была изучена взаимосвязь показателей самооценки семей
мигрантов в эмоциональных ситуациях с продолжительностью миграции и семейной
жизни. На основании полученных результатов можно сказать, что существует
отрицательная корреляция между продолжительностью миграции и шкалами
спокойствие-тревожность. Чем длительнее период трудовой миграции, тем ниже уровень
душевного спокойствия и выше уровень тревожности у трудовых мигрантов (r=-0,223;
p<0,01). Согласно результатам, подобные результаты не наблюдаются в семьях без
мигрантов. В частности, пары из семей, не являющихся мигрантами, оценивают себя как
спокойных, волевых и уверенных в себе людей в общении друг с другом. Анализ
полученных результатов позволяет сделать вывод о том, что низкий уровень достижений
в семьях мигрантов, неполное выполнение ожиданий от окружения и неуверенность в
преодолении трудностей из-за неуверенности в себе повышают вероятность
возникновения повышенной потребности как со стороны семьи, так и со стороны
партнера, будь то духовной, моральной или материальной, что в свою очередь приводит
к неудовлетворенности между парами. Все эмоциональные состояния, связанные с
мигрантами, формируются на основе способности понимать и контролировать ситуацию,
возникающую во время миграции.
Еще одним заметным отличием является то, что в семьях трудовых мигрантов
расстояние между членами семьи и их повышенная чувствительность к изменениям
окружающей среды также оказывают определенное влияние на эмоциональное
состояние, что приводит к более частым разлукам и «разрывам» супружеских отношений
среди членов семей мигрантов. В частности, в семьях без мигрантов в определенных
ситуациях в семье пары оценивают себя как личностей, обладающих такими качествами,
как независимость, отстаивание собственных взглядов, ожиданий и сильная воля. Они

проявляют инициативу и активность в отношениях, и пара стремится создать
амбициозные, активные, полные энтузиазма и продуктивные супружеские отношения.
Выводы. Подводя итог, можно сказать, что сегодня в нашей стране в связи с
трудовой миграцией происходят социально-психологические и ценностные изменения у
людей. Среди таких негативных последствий можно выделить семейные кризисы,
психологические изменения личности, изменения эмоционального фона, в результате
чего в жизни человека возникает множество проблем. С другой стороны, так происходит
не во всех семьях, и есть задачи, которые необходимо решить, о чем мы поговорим в
следующем абзаце.

bo‘lishadi. Ushbu holatlarning sabablari organizmda yuz beradigan fiziologik va gormonal

o‘zgarishlar, shuningdek ijtimoiy-psixologik omillar bilan chambarchas bog‘liqdir [1; 2].
Reproduktiv davr fazalari davomida yuzaga keladigan emotsional buzilishlarni aniqlash va
korreksiya qilish zamonaviy psixologiya va tibbiyot fanining muhim yo‘nalishlaridan biridir.
Reproduktiv davr davomida ayollar organizmida yuzaga keladigan fiziologik va
gormonal o‘zgarishlar psixoemotsional holatga bevosita ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Tadqiqotlar shuni
ko‘rsatadiki, estrogen, progesteron va kortizol kabi gormonlarning dinamik o‘zgarishi stress,
xavotir va depressiv holatlarning shakllanishiga sabab bo‘ladi [2; 5; 6]. Ushbu o‘zgarishlar hayz
tsikli, homiladorlik, tug‘ruqdan keyingi davr va perimenopauza bosqichlarida alohida yaqqol
namoyon bo‘lib, emotsional barqarorlikni susaytiradi. Quyida reproduktiv davr fazalarining har
bir bosqichida emotsional buzilishlar xususiyatlari batafsil yoritiladi. 1. Hayz tsikli fazalarida
stress va xavotir Hayz tsiklining lutein fazasida organizmda progesteron darajasining ortishi va
estrogen darajasining pasayishi psixoemotsional labillik va stress reaksiyalarining kuchayishiga
olib keladi [2; 4]. Yonkers va hammualliflari hayz tsiklining ushbu bosqichida PMS va PMDD
simptomlarining ortishini, shuningdek, xavotir va depressiv kayfiyat o‘zgarishlarining sezilarli
ko‘payishini aniqlagan [4]. Bizning tahlillarimiz ham lutein fazada ayollarda emotsional
o‘zgarishlar darajasining oshishini tasdiqlaydi. Homiladorlik davrida emotsional o‘zgarishlar
Homiladorlikning birinchi va uchinchi trimestrlarida progesteron va kortizol gormonlarining
sezilarli darajada oshishi natijasida emotsional barqarorlik zaiflashadi [5]. Soares va Zitek
tomonidan olib borilgan tadqiqotlar homiladorlik paytida gormonal fondagi o‘zgarishlar xavotir
va depressiv simptomlarning shakllanishiga olib kelishini ko‘rsatadi [5]. Ayniqsa,
homiladorlikning so‘nggi trimestrida ruhiy holatdagi noaniqlik va stress darajasi oshadi. 3.
Tug‘ruqdan keyingi depressiya Tug‘ruqdan so‘ng ayol organizmida estrogen va progesteron
darajasining keskin pasayishi postnatal depressiyaning rivojlanishiga turtki beradi [6].
Ayvazyan ta’kidlaganidek, biologik gormonal o‘zgarishlar bilan birga ijtimoiy-psixologik
omillar (masalan, chaqaloq parvarishining murakkabligi, uyqu buzilishlari) ham tug‘ruqdan
keyingi depressiya shakllanishiga yordam beradi [6]. Bu davrda ayollarning emotsional
sezgirligi va stressga chidamliligi sezilarli ravishda pasayadi. 4. Perimenopauzada emotsional
buzilishlar Perimenopauza davrida estrogen darajasining pasayishi markaziy nerv tizimida
serotonerjik tizim faoliyatining susayishiga olib keladi [7]. Shabanov va Lebedev tadqiqotlari
perimenopauza bosqichida stress va depressiv holatlar ortishini ko‘rsatadi [7]. Tahlillarimizga
ko‘ra, bu davrda ayollar emotsional barqarorlikni saqlashda ko‘proq qiyinchiliklarga duch
keladi. 5. Zamonaviy korrektsiya usullari Stress, xavotir va depressiv holatlarni kamaytirish
uchun zamonaviy psixoterapevtik va farmakologik yondashuvlardan foydalanish tavsiya etiladi.
Tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, kognitiv-behavioral terapiya (CBT) va mindfulness amaliyotlari
stressni kamaytirishda samarali vositalardan biridir [8]. Shuningdek, gormonal terapiya (HRT)
va selektiv serotonin qayta qabul inhibitörlari (SSRI) emotsional buzilishlarni davolashda keng
qo‘llaniladi [9]. Sog‘lom turmush tarzini shakllantirish ham stress va depressiyani
kamaytirishga xizmat qiladi.
192

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Ushbu tadqiqot biopsixosotsial modelga asoslangan bo‘lib, sog‘liq va kasallikning
biologik, psixologik va ijtimoiy omillar o‘zaro ta’siri asosida tushuntiriladi [9].
Tadqiqot davomida aniqlanishicha, reproduktiv davr fazalarida yuzaga keladigan stress,
xavotir va depressiya holatlari gormonal fondagi o‘zgarishlar bilan bevosita bog‘liqdir. Hayz
tsiklining lutein fazasida progesteron darajasining ortishi va estrogen darajasining pasayishi
natijasida emotsional o‘zgarishlar, asabiylashish va xavotir kuchayishi kuzatiladi [2; 4].
Ayniqsa PMS va PMDD simptomlari bu davrda keskin namoyon bo‘ladi. Homiladorlik va
perimenopauza davrida ham shunga o‘xshash psixoemotsional buzilishlar kuchayishi
aniqlangan [5]. Shuningdek, olib borilgan tahlillar natijalariga ko‘ra, homiladorlikning birinchi
va uchinchi trimestrlarida progesteron va kortizol gormonlarining keskin ortishi tufayli xavotir
va depressiv holatlar ortishi ehtimoli oshadi. Tug‘ruqdan so‘ng esa estrogen va progesteron
darajasining keskin pasayishi psixoemotsional beqarorlikka olib keladi, bu esa tug‘ruqdan
keyingi depressiya rivojlanishiga sabab bo‘lishi mumkin [6]. Perimenopauza davrida estrogen
darajasining pasayishi serotonerjik tizim faolligini kamaytirib, depressiv kayfiyat va
motivatsiya pasayishiga olib keladi [7]. Zamonaviy ilmiy tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki,
reproduktiv davrda yuzaga keladigan emotsional buzilishlarning shakllanishi ko‘p omilli
mexanizmga ega bo‘lib, unda biologik (gormonal fondagi o‘zgarishlar), psixologik (ichki
emotsional reaktsiyalar) va ijtimoiy (oilaviy va ijtimoiy qo‘llab-quvvatlash darajasi) omillar
o‘zaro ta’sir qiladi. Shu sababli, reproduktiv davr fazalarida stress, xavotir va depressiyani
baholash va korreksiya qilishda biopsixosotsial yondashuv qo‘llash eng samarali strategiya
sifatida tavsiya qilinadi. Biopsixosotsial model asosida olib borilayotgan tahlillar shuni
ko‘rsatadiki, ayol organizmining reproduktiv fazalarida yuzaga keladigan emotsional
buzilishlar nafaqat fiziologik jarayonlarga, balki psixik holat va ijtimoiy muhit bilan ham uzviy
bog‘liqdir. Masalan, Premenstrual disforik buzilish (PMDD) hayz tsiklining oxirgi kunlarida
kuchli depressiya, tajovuzkorlik va yig‘loqilik holatlari bilan kechishi mumkin. Bu holat odatiy
PMSga qaraganda ancha og‘ir bo‘lib, ayolning ijtimoiy va kasbiy faoliyatiga jiddiy ta’sir
ko‘rsatadi. Ilmiy manbalarda bu holatga chalingan ayollarning miya faoliyatida amigdala va
prefrontal korteks o‘rtasidagi neyron aloqalarda izchil o‘zgarishlar qayd etilgan.
Homiladorlik davrida esa gormonlar darajasining o‘zgarishi ayol psixikasida sezilarli
farqlarni yuzaga keltiradi. Ayniqsa, progesteron va kortizol darajasining oshishi stressga
sezuvchanlikni kuchaytiradi. Ba’zi hollarda bu holat o‘ta xavotirli fikrlar, uyqusizlik, doimiy
tashvish va ichki betinchilik bilan namoyon bo‘ladi. Tug‘ruqdan keyingi davrda esa estrogen
va progesteron miqdorining keskin kamayishi serotoninning ishlab chiqarilishiga ta’sir
ko‘rsatib, postnatal depressiya holatini keltirib chiqaradi. Tadqiqotlarga ko‘ra, har 7 ayoldan
biri tug‘ruqdan so‘ng psixologik yordamga muhtoj bo‘ladi.
Perimenopauza va menopauza davrida esa organizmning gormonlarga bo‘lgan
moslashuvi ancha murakkab kechadi. Bu bosqichda ayollar ko‘p hollarda o‘zlarini yolg‘iz,
tushkun, foydasiz deb his qilishadi. Estrogenning kamayishi serotonerjik va dopaminerjik
tizimlarga salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Bu esa nafaqat kayfiyatning tushishiga, balki umumiy hayotiy
193

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

motivatsiyaning pasayishiga ham olib keladi. Aynan shu davrda ayollar o‘rtasida o‘ziga qasd
qilish fikrlari yoki jiddiy depressiv epizodlar tez-tez uchraydi. Shuning uchun, bu bosqichda
profilaktik psixologik yondashuvlar, masalan, kognitiv-behavioral terapiya, ijtimoiy yordam
tarmoqlari va psixodinamik terapiya metodlarini joriy qilish zaruriy hisoblanadi.
Bunday murakkab davrlar uchun biopsixosotsial modelning afzalligi shundaki, u faqat
biologik sabablarni emas, balki shaxsning ichki tajribalari, emotsional tarixini ham hisobga
oladi. Masalan, ilgari depressiyaga chalingan ayollarda homiladorlik yoki perimenopauza
davrida qayta psixoemotsional buzilishlar xavfi yuqori bo‘ladi. Shuningdek, oiladagi qo‘llabquvvatlovchi munosabatlar, turmush o‘rtog‘ining roli, ijtimoiy bosim yoki mehnatdagi
zo‘riqishlar ham ushbu simptomlarning kuchayishida asosiy omillardan biri sifatida baholanadi.
Psixologik xizmatlar tizimida bunday ayollar bilan ishlashda maxsus psixodiagnostik
usullar — masalan, Beck depressiya shkalasi, Hamilton xavotir shkalasi, EPDS (Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale) kabi testlar qo‘llanilishi tavsiya qilinadi. Ushbu vositalar orqali
ayolning emotsional holatini erta aniqlash va zarur psixokorreksion chora-tadbirlarni qo‘llash
imkoniyati oshadi. Ayniqsa, ijtimoiy-pedagogik muassasalarda, ayollar maslahat markazlarida,
shifoxonalarda psixologlar faoliyatini kuchaytirish, ayollar salomatligiga kompleks
yondashuvni shakllantirish zarur.
Zamonaviy yondashuvlarda sog‘lom turmush tarzi, ijtimoiy faollik, jismoniy mashqlar
va san’at terapiyasining psixologik salomatlikka ijobiy ta’siri alohida ta’kidlanmoqda.
Serotonin ishlab chiqarilishini stimulyatsiya qiluvchi omillar — quyosh nuri, jismoniy
harakatlar, to‘g‘ri ovqatlanish — depressiv holatlarni yengillashtirishi mumkin. Shuningdek,
o‘z-o‘zini qadrlashni oshiruvchi guruh terapiyalari, oilaviy maslahatlar va emotsional razryadga
yo‘naltirilgan treninglar ijobiy natija beradi.
Olib borilgan tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, ayollarning reproduktiv davrida
yuzaga keladigan fiziologik va gormonal o‘zgarishlar ularning emotsional holatiga bevosita
ta’sir qiladi. Hayz tsikli, homiladorlik, tug‘ruqdan keyingi davr va perimenopauza kabi
bosqichlarda stress, xavotir va depressiv holatlarning rivojlanishi gormonlar darajasidagi
dinamik o‘zgarishlar bilan chambarchas bog‘liqdir. Gormonal siljishlar markaziy nerv tizimi
faoliyatiga ta’sir qilib, psixoemotsional barqarorlikni pasaytiradi va ruhiy salomatlikda
muammolar yuzaga kelishiga sabab bo‘ladi.
Ayollarning ruhiy salomatligini saqlash va emotsional barqarorlikni ta’minlash uchun
psixologik va tibbiy chora-tadbirlarni integratsiyalash muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Bu borada
kognitiv-behavioral terapiya, ongli diqqat amaliyotlari (mindfulness), gormonal terapiya va
zarurat tug‘ilganda farmakologik davo usullaridan foydalanish samarali hisoblanadi. Shu bilan
birga, sog‘lom turmush tarzini shakllantirish (muntazam jismoniy faoliyat, sifatli uyqu,
muvozanatli ovqatlanish) stressni kamaytirish va ruhiy salomatlikni qo‘llab-quvvatlashda
asosiy rol o‘ynaydi. Kelgusida ushbu sohada ko‘proq longitudinal va eksperimental tadqiqotlar
olib borish tavsiya etiladi.

Respublikamizda shunday zarur ijtimoiy-siyosiy va iqtisodiy muhit yaratilmoqdaki, u yosh
196

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

avlodning sog‘lig‘i haqida g‘amxo‘rlik qilish, uni muhofaza qilish masalalari davlatimizning
ustuvor yo‘nalishlaridan biriga aylantirilganidan dalolat bermoqda.
Adabiyotlar tahlili. Bu soha bo‘yicha O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidentining 2020-yil
30-oktabrdagi «Sog‘lom turmush tarzini keng tatbiq etish va ommaviy sportni yanada
rivojlantirish chora-tadbirlari to‘g‘risida» PF-6099-son Farmoni qabul qilinishi, shu dasturning
aholi orasida har tomonlama qo‘llab-quvvatlanishi ana shundan guvohlik berib turibdi.
Salomatlikni an’anaviy ravishda qadrlashni qayta tiklash, shaxs madaniyatini, uning o‘z
sog‘lig‘i haqida g‘amxo‘rlik qilishni oila, maktab, mahalla, sog‘liqni saqlash ijtimoiy
jamg‘arma, jismoniy tarbiya va sport tizimining butun kuchlari bilan eng yosh vaqtidan boshlab
joriy etishda yordamlashish zarur. Shunisi muhimki, odamlar sog‘liqni so‘zda emas, balki
amalda qadrlashni o‘rganib olishlari zarurdir.
Davlat rahbarimizning farmoniga muvofiq o‘sib kelayotgan yosh avlodning jismoniy va
ma’naviy salomatligini shakllantirishning, sog‘lom turmush tarziga intilish va sportga mehrmuhabbatni singdirishning g‘oyat muhim sharti sifatida yoshlar o‘rtasida ommaviy sportini
rivojlantirishni ta’minlash maqsadida qabul qilindi. Jismoniy madaniyat va sport hamisha
jamiyat hayotining ajralmas bir qismi bo‘lib kelgan. Bizgacha mavjud bo‘lgan ijtimoiy jamoalar
ham o‘z rivojlanishida jismoniy tarbiya va sportga katta ahamiyat berganlar.
O‘tmishda kurash, yugurish, sakrash bilan bog‘liq harakatli milliy o‘yinlar xalq orasida
keng tarqalgan, har xil tantana, Navro‘z bayramlari va to‘ylarda musobaqalar o‘tkazilgan va
ular tarbiyaviy ahamiyatga ega bo‘lgan. Bundan 3 ming yil oldin yaratilgan zardushtiylik
dinining muqaddas kitobi «Avesto»da juda ko‘p hayotiy muammolar xususida bahslar,
mulohazayu mushohadalar mavjud. Zurriyotning pokizaligi, naslning sog‘lomligi xususida
qayg‘urish shular jumlasidandir. «Avesto»da atrof-muhitni muhofaza qilish, jamoat, oila,
shaxsiy ozodalik, gigiena xususida pand-nasihatlar berilganda aqliy, jismoniy, ruhiy, jinsiy
sog‘lom bo‘lish omillari ham birma-bir sanab o‘tiladiki, unga rioya qilish me’yori nizomlari
uqtiriladi. Unda «sog‘lom, aqli hushi tetik farzandlarga, jasur, dono, turli tillarni biladigan,
uzoqni ko‘ra biladigan o‘g‘il-qizlarga, yurtni balo-qazolardan himoya eta oladigan o‘g‘lonlarga,
yaxshi kelajak, porloq hayotni ravshan ko‘z bilan ko‘ra oladigan pok ziynat avlodlarga olqishlar
bo‘lsin» deyilgan. «Avesto»dagi ko‘plab dalillar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, qadimgi ajdodlarimiz
bolalarning chaqaloqligidan jismoniy, aqliy va jinsiy tarbiyasiga jiddiy e’tibor berishgan,
ularning fikricha, yosh bolalar ochiq havoda, jismoniy mehnatga chiniqib voyaga yetishlari
lozim.
Tahlil va natijalar. «Avesto»da inson organizmi mushak, suyak, teri, miya, asab, badan,
tomir va qonga bo‘lingan. Badanning quvvati esa tom, vijdon, ravon (tan), idrok va azaliy ruh
kabi 5 qismga bo‘lingan.
«Avesto»da muhofaza qilish, suv, zamin, xona, badan, kiyim-kechak, oziq-ovqatlarni
toza tutish va bolalarni chiniqtirishga ham katta e’tibor berilgan.

Ibn Sino o‘z risolasining to‘rtinchi bobida «jismoniy tarbiya mashqlari saviya va son
jihatdan juda kishini charchatadigan bo‘lmasligi kerak. Ular juda tez ham bo‘lmasligi kerak,
aks holda ular qisqa davom etishiga qaramay kishiga uzoq bo‘lib tuyuladi, shuningdek, bu
mashqlar o‘ta bo‘sh bo‘lmasligi ham kerak, aks holda ular uzoq davom etadigan mashqlar bo‘lsa
ham kishiga juda qisqa bo‘lib tuyulmasin» - deydi.
Sog‘lom turmush tarzi va sog‘liqni saqlashda Abu Ali ibn Sino asosan yetti narsaga
e’tiborni kuchaytirish zarurligini uqtirib o‘tadi:
1. Mijozni mo‘tadil qilish.
2. Yeyiladigan va ichiladigan ovqatlarni tanlash.
3. Gavdani chiqindidan tozalash.
4. To‘g‘ri tuzilishni tozalash.
5. Burun orqali olinadigan havoni yetarli va yaxshi olish.
6. Kiyimga e’tibor berish.
7. Jismoniy va ruhiy harakatlarni tartibga solish.
Mijoz elementlari 4 ga bo‘linadi: issiqlik, sovuqlik, ho‘llik va quruqlik.
Umuman olganda mijoz ikkiga bo‘linadi: birinchisi haqiqiy mo‘tadil mijoz (shartsiz
refleks), bunda mijoz egasidagi qarama-qarshi kayfiyatlarning miqdorlari teng bo‘ladi.
Ikkinchisida (shartli refleks) qarama-qarshi kayfiyatlar orasida mijoz mutlaqo o‘rtada bo‘lmay,
ikki tomonning biriga, ya’ni sovuqlik yoki issiqlikka, ho‘llik yoki quruqlikka yoki har ikkisiga
moyilroq bo‘ladi.
Kasallikning oldini olish va sog‘lomlashtirishda mijoz elementlariga e’tibor berilsa,
yaxshi natija beradi. Abu Ali ibn Sinoning «Tib qonunlari» kitobida kasallikning oldini olish,
davolashga doir maslahatlar, inson salomatligining atrof-muhitdagi omillarga bog‘liqligi
haqidagi fikrlar bildirilgan.
Bolaning ilk yoshidan boshlab gigienik asosda tarbiyalashni Ibn Sino sog‘liqni
saqlashning eng asosiy jihati deb hisoblagan.
Uning fikricha, bola fe’l-atvorining vazminligiga e’tiborni qaratish zarurdir. Ruh va
tananing sog‘ligini saqlashga shu tariqa erishiladi. Bolani gigienik tarbiyalashning umumiy
tizimida jismoniy mashqlar yetakchi o‘rin egallaydi. Abu Ali ibn Sino buni davolash deb ataydi.

Bulardan ko‘rinib turibdiki, Ibn Sino o‘rta asrlardayoq jismoniy tarbiya mashg‘ulotlarining
inson hayotida tutgan o‘rni va mohiyatini nazariy asoslab bergan.
XIII-XIV asr o‘zbek poeziyasining atoqli namoyondasi, mashhur ruboiynavis shoir,
otashin xalqparvar Pahlavon Mahmud (1247-1326) o‘z davrining ajoyib sportchisi ham bo‘lgan.
U milliy kurash bo‘yicha xalq musobaqalarida qatnashib, hamma raqiblarini yenggan, g‘oliblik
evaziga mukofotlar emas, balki shu joy hokimlaridan Xorazmdan keltirgan qullar va asirlarini
ozod etishni talab qilgan. O‘sha davrda sportning kurash turi Turkiston hududida gurkirab
rivojlangan hamda u xalq orasida juda ommabop bo‘lgan.
Buyuk Sohibqiron Amir Temur jismoniy tarbiyaga katta e’tibor qaratgan.
«Temurnomada» yozilishicha, Temur o‘spirinlik davrida tengdoshlari bilan o‘zining ko‘p
vaqtini jismoniy mashqlar va harbiy o‘yinlarga ajratgan. Temurning o‘zi va o‘yinlarning boshqa
ishtirokchilari ham katta jismoniy tayyorgarlikdan so‘ng buyuk lashkarboshilar bo‘lib
yetishgan.
Ulug‘ shoir va mutafakkir Alisher Navoiy (1441-1501) o‘z asarlarida jismoniy tarbiya
va sport g‘oyalarini oldinga surib, o‘z qahramonlarini jismonan kuchli, baquvvat va chiroyli
insonlar sifatida ta’riflaganlar.
Ko‘rinib turibdiki, alloma naslning sog‘ligi, jamiyat a’zolarining sog‘lom turmush tarzi
jamiyatning ravon osuda hayoti, farovon turmushini ta’minlashga xizmat qilishini nazarda tutib,
inson salomatligini saqlash hamda tiklash borasidagi o‘z qimmatli fikr va qarashlarini o‘lmas
va betakror asarlarida ifoda etgan. Respublikamizda qabul qilingan “Sog‘liqni saqlash tizimini
isloh qilish” to‘g‘risidagi dastur, “Sog‘lom avlod” jamg‘armasi va ordenining ta’sis etilishi,
“Ona va bola” markazlarining tashkil etilishi, “Yoshlar yili”, “Barkamol avlod”, “Yoshlarni
qo‘llab quvvatlash va aholi salomatligini mustahkamlash” , “Yoshlarni qo‘llab quvvatlash
hamda aholi salomatligini mustahkamlash” yillarining e’lon qilinishi Prezidentimiz va
Respublika rahbariyatining bu sohaga bo‘lgan e’tiborlarining naqadar katta ekanligini
ko‘rsatadi. Kelajakda ham jismonan, ham ma’nan sog‘lom avlodni voyaga etkazish masalasida
ajdodlarimizning qarashlari va faoliyati ma’naviy asoslardan biri bo‘lib xizmat qilishi,
shuningdek, ulardan foydalanish islohotlarni yanada samaraliroq borishi va o‘tkazilishiga
yordam berishi shubhasizdir.
Xulosa. Shunday qilib, Sharq mutafakkirlari yoshlarning sog‘lig‘ini mustahkamlash va
muhofaza qilishda jismoniy tarbiyaning ahamiyatiga katta baho berganlar. Ular toza havoning
ahamiyati, terini parvarish qilish qoidalariga, organizmni chiniqtirishga jismoniy mashqlarga
ko‘p e’tibor berganlar.

KIRISH
Dunyo mamlakatlarida sport o‘yinlari turlarini ommaviylashtirish, uning zamonaviy
bosqichga olib chiqish va raqobatbardosh sportchilarni tayyorlash ijtimoiy siyosatning ustuvor
yo‘nalishlaridan biri hisoblanadi. Ta’kidlash joizki, jahonda jamoaviy sport turlarini
rivojlantirish, iqtidorli yoshlarni sportga keng jalb etish, ularda sport ko‘nikma va
malakalarini shakllantirish, sportchilarni psixologik tayyorgarligiga alohida e’tibor qaratish,
sport faoliyatida psixologik xizmatni to‘g‘ri tashkil etish va uning samaradorligini aniqlash,
sport jamoalari faoliyatini muvaffaqiyatli tashkil etish uchun unga salbiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadigan
omillarni oldini olish, bartaraf etishga yo‘naltirilgan tavsiyalarni amaliyotga tatbiq qilish,
musobaqa oldi o‘quv mashg‘ulotlarini ilmiy asosda tashkil qilish yuzasidan ko‘plab ilmiy
tadqiqot ishlari olib borilgan. Jahonda bugungi kun talablariga mos sportchilarni tayyorlash
uchun ularni jismoniy imkoniyatlari bilan bir qatorda psixologik tayyorgarligiga ham alohida
e’tibor qaratish dolzarb masalalardan biri hisoblanadi.
АDАBIYОTLАR TАHLILI VА METОDОLОGIYА
Psixologik xizmat metodologiyasi va uning ilmiy talqini, sport sohasida psixologik
xizmatni tashkil etish, uni samaradorligini baholash hamda sportchilarni psixologik
tayyorlashda psixologik xizmatni o‘rni masalalari xorij tadqiqotchilari A.Bandura, R.B.Catell,
X.Xekxauzen, Z.Freyd, A.Maslau, E.Fromm, R.S.Uensberg, A.Ts.Puni, R.S.Uensberg larning
ilmiy izlanishlarida keng aks etgan.
Hozirgi zamon ijtimoiy psixologik tadqiqotlar masalasi, ayniqsa uning amaliy vazifalari
sotsial psixologiyaning markazida turuvchi psixologik va sotsiologik yondashuv yo‘nalishlari
asosida hal qilinmoqda. Amerika va g‘arb davlatlarida ikki turdagi ijtimoiy psixologiya:
“psixologik ijtimoiy psixologiya” va “sotsiologik ijtimoiy psixologiya” yo‘nalishlari
mavjuddir. Bu yo‘nalishlar bir-biriga o‘xshasa-da, ularning farqli jihatlari ham mavjud. Ya’ni,
psixologik ijtimoiy psixologiya shaxs va faoliyat, muomala, jamoadagi shaxslararo munosabat,
shaxsning ijtimoiy-psixologik tuzilishi, shaxsning kognitiv, konativ, xulq-atvor imkoniyatlarini
o‘z ichiga olgan ijtimoiy ustanovkalar, shaxs va jamoaning ijtimoiy-ruhiy kechinmalari kabi
muammolar ustida tadqiqot olib borishni maqsad qilib olgan bo‘lsa, sotsiologik ijtimoiy
psixologiyada esa ko‘pincha jamiyatning ijtimoiy qatlamlarini tahlil qiluvchi xalqlar
psixologiyasi, ommaviy hodisalar psixologiyasi, sinflar, guruh va jamoalar, gumanistik
psixologiya kabilarga alohida e’tibor qaratiladi. Psixologik xizmat metodologiyasi esa ko‘proq
birinchi yo‘nalish- “psixologik ijtimoiy psixologiya” asoslari zamirida tarkib topadi.
Ta’kidlash joizki, har bir fanning rivojlanishi yangi dalillar asosida ilmiy yo‘nalishni
ochib beruvchi metodik qurilmalarning tuzilishi bilan bevosita bog‘liqdir. Chunki, aniq
metodologiya bo‘lmagan sohada amaliy natijalar ham ko‘zga tashlanmaydi. Zero, ijtimoiy
psixologiya fanining yana bir muhim yangi vazifasi psixologik xizmat metodologiyasi bilan
202

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

bog‘liq nazariy, amaliy va empirik yo‘nalishdagi tadqiqotlar ko‘lamini belgilashning bugungi
kungacha nechog‘li hal qilinayotganligini tahlil qilishga to‘g‘ri keladi.
O‘yin o‘quvchilar uchun shunday bosqichki, bunda ular yangi bilim va tushunchalarni
egallashga qaratilgan mustaqil faoliyatni boshlaydilar. Bolalar maktab tajriba uchastkasida
ishlash va uyda foydali mehnat qilishdan tashqari, bo‘sh vaqtlarining bir qismini turli o‘yin va
ermaklarga sarflaydilar. Bunday qilish ularga o‘z ehtiyojlarini qondirish va yaxshi dam olish
imkonini beradi. Harakatli o‘yinlar bola harakatlarini o‘stirish va takomillashtirishda katta
ahamiyatga ega bo‘lgan yurish, yugurish, sakrash, biror narsani irg‘itish yoki uloqtirish, biror
narsaga tirmashib chiqish kabi mashqlarni o‘z ichiga oladi.
Harakatlarning takomillashishi bilan birga, jismoniy qobiliyat ham taraqqiy etadi, yurak
va nafas olish sistemasining faoliyati yaxshilanadi. Bundan tashqari harakatli o‘yinlar bolalarni
jismoniy jihatdan o‘stirish uchungina emas, balki aqliy va ahloqiy jihatdan tarbiyalash uchun
ham muhim ahamiyatga egadir. Jamoa bo‘lib o‘ynaladigan o‘yinlarda bolalarda maqsadga
erishish uchun farosatlilik va qat’iyatlilik ko‘rsatish, jamoa oldida, o‘z xattiharakatlari
uchungina emas, balki o‘rtoqlarining xatti-harakalari uchun ham mas’uliyatni sezish xislatlari
tarbiyalanadi.
Bu borada psixologiya olamida bugungi kungacha aniq va mukammal tarzda ishlab
chiqilgan va rasmiy tarzda tan olingan yagona ilmiy yo‘nalish yoki kontseptsiyaning qabul
qilinmaganligi ma’lum bo‘lsada, ilg‘or g‘arb psixologlari, MDH va O‘zbekiston psixologlari
tomonidan olib borilgan va olib borilayotgan (eksperimental izlanishlarga yo‘l ochib
berilayotgan) tadqiqotlar mavjudki, ular muhim jihati bilan psixologik xizmat modeli va uning
psixologik himoya vositasi sifatidagi mohiyati, ahamiyati va ijtimoiy istiqbollari haqidagi
ilmiy-amaliy tasavvurlarimizni shakllantirishga asos bo‘lib xizmat qilishi mumkin.
Ilmiy adabiyotlardan
ma’lum
bo‘lishicha,
ijtimoiy psixologik
xizmat
metodologiyasining umumiy yo‘nalishlari g‘arb ijtimoiy psixologiya namoyondalari
tadqiqotlarini quyidagicha izohlash mumkin: V.Vundtning 1900 yilda chop etilgan “Xalqlar
psixologiyasi” nomli yirik (o‘n tomlik) epik asari ijtimoiy psixologiya yo‘nalishlarini
yorqinlashtirishga xizmat qilib, inson ma’naviyati, madaniyati va mafkurasini o‘rganishning
murakkab tomonlarini ochib berdi. Taniqli ingliz psixologi Vilyam Makdugallning 1908 yilda
yozilgan “Ijtimoiy psixologiyaga kirish” asaridagi “ijtimoiy xulq-atvor instinktlari” nazariyasi
freydizmga qarshi o‘laroq inson instinktlari va faoliyat uyg‘unligini ta’minlash muammosini
yoritishga ilk bor asos bo‘lib xizmat qildi.
Binobarin, E.Fromm, J.Saliven, V.Shutts, G.Sheparde, V.Bayon kabi olimlar tomonidan
jamoalar psixologiyasi nazariyasini yaratishga asos solindi. Bunda turli xil ijtimoiy psixologik
treninglar orqali jamoalardagi shaxslararo munosabatlar bilan bog‘liq psixologik iqlimni kamol
toptirish yo‘llarining ilk bor ko‘rsatilishi sport jamoalaridagi ijtimoiy psixologik xizmat
vazifalarini belgilash uchun ma’lum darajadagi empirik ma’lumot sifatida xizmat qilishi
mumkin.

NАTIJА VА MUHОKАMА
Inson psixologiyasini tushunish, tahlil qilish, rivojlantirishga jiddiy e’tibor berish
masalasi hamma vaqt va ko‘p mamlakatlarda ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy taraqqiyotning etakchi
vazifalaridan biri bo‘lib kelgan. XX asr boshlarida psixologiya fani va uning rivojlanishiga
ulkan hissa qo‘shgan olimlar o‘zlarining navbatdagi jahonshumul ilmiy maqsadlari- inson va
jamiyatga psixologik xizmat ko‘rsatish tizimining muqarrarligini nazariy-ilmiy jihatdan asoslab
berishga muvaffaq bo‘ldilar.
Umuman, psixologik xizmat ko‘rsatish muammosi ma’lum ma’noda, ilmiy
psixologiyaning etakchi yo‘nalishlaridan biri sifatida ko‘p bor munozaralar markazidagi
dolzarb masala sifatida qarab kelingan. Bu haqida dastlabki psixologik tasavvurlar makoni
Hindiston, Xitoy, egipet, Vavilon, O‘rta Osiyo, Gretsiyadan, shuningdek, jon (ruh) haqidagi
kitobning muallifi Aristoteldan hamda temperament (mijoz) ta’limotining asoschilari Galen va
Gippokratdan tortib, hozirgi kunga qadar psixologlar o‘z fikr-mulohazalarini bildirib
kelmoqdalar. Zero, shaxs va uning faoliyatini ilmiy o‘rganish muammosiga psixologiyaning
amaliy-tatbiqiy yo‘nalishlari asosida yondashish zarurligi haqida ko‘pgina olimlar o‘z
tadqiqotlarida ta’kidlab o‘tgan.
Ayniqsa, I.V.Dubrovina, X.Y.Liymets, Yu.L.Sierdlarning ko‘p yillik tadqiqotlari natijasi
o‘laroq, sport jamoalarida psixologik xizmatning joriy etilishi bu boradagi MDH
mamlakatlarida qo‘yilgan ilk qadam ekanligini alohida qayd etish mumkin.
Psixologik xizmat AQShda 1800 yillardan boshlab rivojlana boshladi. AQShning
amaliyotchi psixologlari o‘z-o‘zini boshqarish va shakllantirish muammosini o‘rgangan
eksperemental tadqiqot olib borgan etakchi mutaxassis edilar. Amerika maktablarida aqliy
taraqqiyot koeffitsentini aniqlash keng tarqalgan bo‘lib, keyinchalik Gaydens xizmatining
rivojlanishiga olib kelgan.
Farnsuz maktab psixologiyasining otasi Alfred Bine bo‘lib, u bu sohada 1894 yildan
boshlab ish boshlagan. 1905 yilda Frantsiya ta’lim vazirligi A.Binega umumiy dastur bo‘yicha
o‘qiy olmaydigan bolalarni tekshirish muammosi bilan murojaat qilgan va aqliy taraqqiyotdan
orqaga qolgan bolalarni aniqlaydigan mashhur Bine-Simon testi yaratiladi.
1990 yilda Frantsiya ta’lim muasassalarida psixologik xizmatni ko‘rsatish yo‘lga
qo‘yilgan. 1970 yilda Frantsiyada psixologik yordam ko‘rsatuvchi maxsus guruhlar ish
faoliyatni boshladi va ular psixologik xizmat ko‘rsatishning ta’minlovchi dasturini ishlab
chiqishdi. Bunday guruhlar maktab psixologiyasi mutaxassisi, ta’lim psixologiyasi mutaxassisi
va psixomotor rivojlanish bo‘yicha mutaxassislarni o‘z ichiga olgan. Bu guruhlarda 800-1000
nafargacha bo‘lgan o‘quvchiga psixologik xizmat ko‘rsatish imkoniyatiga ega bo‘lgan.
1985 yilda Frantsiya psixologlarining funktsiyalarini aniq bir yo‘nalishga soladigan
mexanizm yaratildi. Ko‘pchilik Sharqiy evropa mamlakatlarida ta’lim muassasalarda
psixologik xizmatni ko‘rsatish tuman yoki viloyat miqiyosidagi psixologik-pedagogik
markazlar tomonidan amalga oshirilgan. Psixologik xizmatning asosiy mazmuni-sog‘lom
shaxsning o‘sishini ta’minlash, shaxs rivojlanishidagi turli qiyinchiliklarni psixodiagnostika va
204

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

psixokorrektsiya qilish, kasb tanlash muammolaridan iborat bo‘lgan. Chexoslovakiya davlatida
psixolog maslahatchining asosiy funktsiyasi psixodiagnostik faoliyatni olib borishdan iboratdir.
“Jamoaviy sport” faoliyat sifatida shunchalik murakkab va o‘ziga xos xususiyatlarga
egaki, unda eng yuqori, muhim va uzoq muddatli muvaffaqiyatga faqatgina uning o‘ziga xos
muhim talablariga javob bera oladigan nomdor va e’tibor qozongan sport jamoalari erishadilar.
Har doim sport faoliyati natijasining yuqori ahamiyati va unga mas’uliyatlilik mazkur faoliyatni
amalda tengi yo‘q faoliyat deb belgilash imkonini beradi.
Sharoitlarning alohida o‘ziga xosligi sportchilar uchun ahamiyatli kechinmalar
kompleksi manbai hisoblanib, sport faoliyatining alohida vaziyatlarini, jumladan, murakkab
vaziyatlarni, buning orqasidan esa, sportchining butun hayot faoliyatini ham o‘zgartirib
yuboradi va mazkur faoliyatni salbiy kechinmalar modeli, ya’ni uni doimiy bartaraf etish va
unga qarshi kurashish modeli sifatida qarab chiqishni taqozo etadi. Boshqa modellardan farqli
o‘laroq, salbiy emotsional kechinmalar sport faoliyatining muhim belgisi hisoblanadi va
muvaffaqiyatga teskari ta’sir ko‘rsatayotgan salbiy kechinmalarning yuzaga kelishi haqida
signal beradi. Bundan tashqari, olimlar sport faoliyatining boshqa mezonlarini o‘rganib,
quyidagilarga alohida e’tibor qaratganlar:
• uning jamoaviy munosabat va muvaffaqiyatga yo‘naltirilganligi;
• shart-sharoit va imkoniyatlarning yaratilganligi (ham mashqlarda, ham
musobaqalarda);
• sportda kichik jarohat olish ehtimoli mavjudligi;
• jamoaviy sport faoliyatning (uzog‘i bilan o‘n yilgacha) “umri qisqaligi”.
XULOSA
Bunday murakkab sport faoliyatni bajarish natijasida sportchilar o‘zining butun sportdagi
hayoti mobaynida turli xil salbiy psixik holatlarga tushib qoladi, ularni bartaraf etish va engish
muvaffaqiyati esa to‘g‘ridan to‘g‘ri sport faoliyatning o‘zidagi yutuqlar bilan aloqador
hisoblanadi.
Tadqiq etilayotgan muammo bo‘yicha adabiyotlar tahlili va empirik tahlillarimiz
natijalari sport jamoalari faoliyatiga ta’sir etadigan salbiy emotsional kechinmalarni shartli
ifoda etuvchi shaxsiy maydonni loyihalash imkonini berdi. Mazkur shaxsiy maydonni
loyihalash tuzilmasiga tayanish asosida sportchilar faoliyatida salbiy hissiy kechinmalarni
muvafaqqiyatli bartaraf etish va engishning ijtimoiy-psixologik modelini ishlab chiqishga
erishdik.
Jamoaviy sport faoliyatida salbiy emotsional kechinmalarni muvafaqqiyatli bartaraf
etish, unga qarshi kurashish va engishning ijtimoiy-psixologik modeli bugungi kunda sport
jamoalari uchun muhim ahamiyatga ega bo‘lib, u quyidagi to‘rt blokni o‘z ichiga oladi: a)
maqsadli blok; b) mazmunli blok; v) jarayonli blok; g) psiodiagnostik bloklardir. Model sport
faoliyatida ta’sir ko‘rsatadigan salbiy emotsional kechinmalarni engish, unga qarshi kurashish
va bartaraf etishning dinamikasini ta’minlaydi.

Kirish. Zamonaviy mehnat bozorida jismoniy tarbiya va spоrt sohasi kadrlari siyosati –
muayyan maqsad yo‘lida faoliyat yuritayotgan ijtimoiy va kasbiy guruhlar (spоrt tashkilotlari,
spоrt federatsiyalari, spоrt uyushmalari va boshqalar), xodim (shu jumladan, spоrtсhi) va
tashkilot (shu jumladan, spоrt jamoasi) o‘rtasidagi munosabatlarni muvofiqlashtirish
jarayonidir. Fanda kadrlar siyosatidagi asosiy muammo – rahbariyat va itoatdagi xodimlar
o‘rtasidagi munosabat bo‘lib, ushbu sohadagi faoliyatni tizimli tashkil etish markaziy masala
sifatida qayd etiladi. Bu muammoni hal etish yo‘lida ma’muriyat personalning spоrt tashkiloti
207

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

faoliyatidagi rolini aniqlashtiradi, mehnat va (yoki) spоrt jamoasi faoliyatining mazmuni,
vazifalari va jamoalar (turli yosh kontekstidagi terma jamoalar) o‘rtasidagi munosabatlarni
uyg‘unlashtiradi. Umuman olganda, jismoniy tarbiya va spоrt sohasi kadrlar siyosatining asosiy
maqsadi – spоrt tashkilotlari ehtiyojlarini qondira oluvсhi spоrtсhi-kadrlarning yangilanishi va
saqlanishi orasida muvozanatni o‘rnatib turishdan iborat bo‘ladi.
Adabiyotlar tahlili. I.I. Мaxmudovning qayd etishiсha, «... kadrlar siyosatidagi eng
muhim jihatlardan biri ushbu siyosatda tashkilot qadriyatlari, uning yuksak maqsadi –
missiyasining mujassamlashganligidir.Мa’lum ma’noda missiya – mukammal ishlangan, aniq
qadriyatlarga asoslangan tashkilot falsafasidir. Dunyodagi deyarli barсha iqtisodiy tetik va
nufuzli tashkilotlar o‘z missiyasi orqali ifodalanuvсhi falsafasi(mafkurasi)ga ega». [1]
Ilmiy-uslubiy adabiyotlar tahlilidan ko‘rinadiki, har bir tashkilot o‘z faoliyatini
mukammallashtirish maqsadida personalga bo‘lgan munosabatini aniqlashtirib boradi va hatto
ba’zi bir сheklanishlarga boradi. Мasalan, spоrt maktablari yaqin o‘tgan davr oralig‘ida o‘z
kasbini mukammal ravishda egallagan mohir mutaxassislarga katta ehtiyoj sezishib, faqatgina
maxsus talablarga javob beradigan spоrt mutaxassis (xorijiy mutaxassis)larnigina ishga qabul
qilishga harakat qilishdi. Jismoniy tarbiya va spоrt sohasidagi zamonaviy mehnat bozori va
kadrlar siyosatida, shunday vaziyat keldi-ki, spоrt tashkilotlari boshqaruviga yetarli tajriba ega
bo‘lmagan va kasbni ish joyida o‘zlashtirishga qodir kreativ fikrlaydigan, tashabbuskorlik va
liderlik xislatlariga ega yosh nomzodlarga – spоrt menejerlariga ehtiyoj sezilmoqda. Shu bois
ham, nazarimizda, spоrt tashkilotidagi bo‘sh boshqaruv o‘rinlariga mos nomzodlarni tanlash,
mavjud xodimlar malakasini muntazam ravishda oshirish, ilg‘or texnologiyalar kirib kelishi
bilan ish o‘rinlarida bo‘ladigan o‘zgarishlar spоrt muassasasining kadrlar siyosati mazmunini
tashkil etmoqda. [2]
Tahlil va natijalar. Sport-ta’lim muassasalari faoliyati rivojlanishining o‘rta va uzoq
muddatli istiqbollarini belgilash, ularda olimpiya va paralimpiya sport turlari bo‘yicha
sportchilar zaxirasini tayyorlash uchun zarur shart-sharoitlar yaratish, shu jumladan ularni
boshqarish va moliyalashtirish tizimini takomillashtirish yuzasidan davlat dasturi ham qabul
qilingan va bu bo‘yicha juda ko‘plab ishlar amalga oshirildi.
Boshqaruvdagi subordinatsiya va koordinatsiya munosabatlari tashkilot miqyosidagi
vertikal va gorizontal aloqalarni ajratish zaruratini tug‘diradi. Demak, vertikal aloqalar o‘zaro
itoatdagi xodimlar o‘rtasida yuzaga keluvchi munosabatlardan iborat bo‘lsa, gorizontal aloqalar
o‘zaro koordinatsiyani, ya’ni tizimning teng va mustaqil qismlari o‘rtasidagi munosabatlarni
nazarda tutadi. Bundan tashqari, boshqaruv munosabatlari o‘zining rasmiy va norasmiy
ko‘rinishiga ham ega.
Rasmiy munosabatlar xizmat majburiyatlariga asoslanadi, norasmiy munosabatlar esa
tashkilot miqyosida xizmat qiluvchi xodimlar o‘rtasidagi ixtiyoriylik va o‘zaro xohishga
tayanadi. Shu munosabat bilan, boshqaruv psixologiyasinig asosiy vazifalaridan biri yuqorida
ta’kidlangan munosabatlarni yanada mukammallashtirishdan iboratdir.[3]
208

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Tashkilot personaliga ta’sir etish uslublarini uch guruhga bo‘lamiz: ma’muriy, moddiy
va ma’naviy shakllarda ta’sir etish. Bularning har birida ma’lum psixologik mazmun namoyon
bo‘ladi va boshqaruv psixologiyasi, fan sifatida, bu choralarning xodimga ta’sirchanlik
imkoniyatini tadqiq etadi.Bunday ta’sir etish tadbirlari orasida xodimlarni motivatsiyalash,
ya’ni bajaradigan mehnatga ishtiyoq uyg‘otish masalasiga katta e’tibor qaratiladi. Boshqaruv
obyektiga ta’sir etish uslublariga ko‘ra, uning bevosita va bavosita ta’sir shakllari ajratiladi. [4]
Zamonaviy yondashuvlardan biri – inson resurslarini rivojlantirishkonsepsiyasi bo‘lib,
bunda tashkilot manfaati yo‘lida xodimning o‘z tashabbusi bo‘yicha samarali mehnat qilishi
uchun yaratiladigan sharoitlar markaziy masala deb qaraladi. Tashkilot personalini rivojlantirish
omili sifatida xodimlarning ehtiyojini aniqlash va qondirish, ularning kasbiy va shaxsiy
kamolotga erishishi uchun shart-sharoit yaratish g‘oyasi yotadi. Aniqlangan ehtiyojlar
majmuasiga har tomonlama ta’sir etish natijasida ishchining mehnatga ijobiy yondashuvi va
samarali mehnati ta’minlanadi.
Qayd etilgan asosiy boshqaruv konsepsiyalari o‘z davriga xos bo‘lgan personal
boshqaruv uslublarini ifodalaydi. Hatto ayni paytda ham turli tashkilot va rahbarlar sanab
o‘tilgan yondashuv elementlarini o‘z faoliyatida qo‘llab keladilar. Tashkilot rahbari mavjud
iqtisodiy ahvol, qo‘l ostidagi xodimlar xususiyatiga asoslangan holda turli yondashuvlardan
birontasiga urg‘u berishi, tashkilot manfaatidan kelib chiqib, u yoki bu yo‘nalish modellarini
jamoalar boshqaruviga tatbiq etishi mumkin. Ammo ko‘zlangan maqsadga tashkilotdagi
personalning faol ishtiroki orqali erishmoqchi bo‘lgan rahbar, iloji boricha o‘z xodimlarida
tashabbusga moyillik, ish natijasi uchun yuksak mas’uliyat uyg‘ota olishi lozim. Aynan shu
maqsadni ko‘zlagan rahbar iloji boricha inson resurslari deb nomlanuvchi yondashuvga
asoslanishi o‘rinlidir. Zamonaviy psixologiya ham iloji boricha insonni aynan shu
nuqtainazarda tushunishga va shaxs kamolotini uning ichki zahiralarini uyg‘otish orqali
erishishga intiladi.[5]
Rahbar shaxsini o‘rganish muammosi kishilik jamiyatining barcha davrlarida muhim
masala bo‘lib kelgan. Buning asosiy sababi birinchidan, har bir davrdagi ijtimoiy munosabatlar
o‘ziga xos ravishda ijtimoiy mavqe jihatidan kimningdir yuqori darajada turishini taqozo etgan
bo‘lsa, ikkinchidan, insonlarning hayot kechirish tarzi, ravnaqi, darajasi, farovonligi, baxtli
turmush kechirishi shu yuqori mavqedagi shaxsga, uning turli fazilatlari va xislatlariga bog‘liq
bo‘lganligidir.
Sharqda o‘z ta’limoti bilan tarixda qolgan buyuk Xitoy faylasufi Konfutsiy, Kun
Futszi(mil. av. 551–479) asarlari, boshqaruv to‘g‘risidagi qarashlari oradan ming yillab vaqt
o‘tib borayotgan bo‘lsa-da dolzarbligini yo‘qotayotgani yo‘q. Zero, Xitoyda Konfutsiy axloqiga
binoan inson dunyo tartiboti tizimida favqulodda o‘rin tutishi, umumiy dunyo taqdiri uchun
mas’ullik hisining cheksizligi targ‘ib etilsa, kosmologiya g‘oyasida siyosat va kosmik ritm
o‘rtasida murosa o‘rnatilishi asoslangan. Xitoy siyosati esa “inson o‘ziga nima” deb emas,
“inson davlat uchun nima” degan savolga javob izlar edi.Inson jamiyatda faqat o‘z qobiliyatiga
tayanib, qachon undan foydalanishlari muddatini kutib yashashga mahkum etilgan edi.Shu
209

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

boisdan ham Xitoyda davlat jamiki jarayonlarni boshqaruvchi kuch sifatida jamiyatda har bir
individning ijtimoiy mavqeini ham belgilab boruvchi omil vazifasini o‘tar edi. Konfutsiy
osmoniy g‘oya nazariyasini ijtimoiy-psixologik tadqiq etgan holda ma’rifiy bo‘yoqlar bilan
yanada rivojlantirdi. Uning nuqtai nazariga ko‘ra, jamiyatni mustahkam munosabatlar tizimiga
ega bo‘lgan oilaga o‘xshatish mumkin. U odamlar o‘rtasidagi munosabatlar tizimini besh
ko‘rinishga ajratadi. Ular quyidagilar:
1) ota va farzand;
2) er va xotin;
3) aka-ukalar;
4) turli oilalar va nihoyat;
5) hukmdor va fuqarolararo munosabatlar.
Inson, Konfutsiy fikriga ko‘ra, nima xayoliga kelsa shuni qilishga emas, balki jamiyat
tomonidan belgilab qo‘yilgan, ijtimoiy tabaqa mohiyatidan kelib chiquvchi majburiyatlarni
bajarishga mas’uldir. Konfutsiy jamiyatni boshqaruv masalasida shunday degan edi: “Agarmeni
hukmdorlardan birortasi jamiyatni boshqaruv ishiga jalb etgudek bo‘lsa, 12 oyda ishda ijobiy
o‘zgarishlar yasagan va uch yil mobaynida boshqaruv ishini tubdan takomillashtirgan bo‘lur
edim”.
Mutafakkir ajdodlarimiz ta’limotida, xalq ijodi mahsullarida adolatli va adolatsiz
munosabatlarning yuzaga kelishi rahbar shaxsi, ya’ni shohga bog‘liq ekanligi to‘g‘risidagi
fikrlarni o‘qiymiz.
Ma’rifatparvar olim Ahmad Donish Maxdum ibn Nosir(1827–1897), ya’ni Ahmad
Donish fikriga ko‘ra, agar boshqaruvchi odil va donishmand bo‘lsa, xalqni qashshoqlikdan
saqlab qolishi mumkin. Davlat bir guruh kishilargagina emas, balki xalq manfaatlariga xizmat
qilishi zarur. Bu uchun esa, hukmdor shaxsi bilimdon, odil, donishmand bo‘lmog‘i lozim.
Mamlakatni idora etishda hukmdor nafaqat o‘z fikriga suyanishi, balki muhim davlat arboblari
bilan maslahatlashib ish yuritishi lozim ekanligi ta’kidlanadi. Chunki ko‘pchilikning aqli bir
kishining aqliga qaraganda ko‘proqdir. Uning fikricha, mamlakatni shunday kishilar
boshqarganda jamiyatda tartib va intizom o‘rnatiladi.To‘g‘ri rahbarlik qilish uchun oldindan
ko‘ra bilish, ro‘y berishi mumkin bo‘lgan o‘zgarish va qiyinchiliklarni oldindan payqash va
nazarga olish zarur. Har bir boshqarish vositasi faoliyatida muayyan tizimning bo‘lishi shart.
Buning ma’nosi shundan iboratki, bu ish tasodifiy bir-biriga aloqasi bo‘lmagan tadbirlar
yig‘indisidan iborat bo‘lmay, balki aniq sharoitni, vaziyat xususiyatini hamda jamoa oldidagi,
shuningdek, uning ayrim bo‘g‘inlari oldida turgan vazifalarning xususiyatlarini qat’iy suratda
tartibga solingan, bir-biri bilan bog‘langan va chuqur o‘ylab ko‘rilgan reja va tadbirlar
majmuasidan iborat bo‘lishi kerakligi ta’kidlangan. [6]
Yuqorida keltirilgan adabiyotlar tahlilidan ko‘rinadiki, tarixiy davlatchilik hududimizda
yashab ijod etgan mutafakkirlar, davlat arboblari, namoyandalar asarlari va qarashlari
boshqarish, rahbarlik muammolariga bag‘ishlangan bo‘lib, ularda ijtimoiy voqelikka nisbatan
ijtimoiy-psixologik yondashish, insonparvarlik g‘oyalari ustuvor etib olingandir.

Annotatsiya. Maqolada 5-7 yoshli bolalar bilan olib boriladigan jismoniy tarbiya
mashg‘ulotlarini takomillashtirishda harakatli o‘yin elementlaridan samarali foydalanish
imkoniyatlari yoritilgan. Tadqiqot davomida harakatli o‘yinlar orqali bolalarning harakat
koordinatsiyasi, tezkorligi, chaqqonligi, ijtimoiy faolligi va jismoniy rivojlanish
ko‘rsatkichlarini yaxshilash mexanizmlari tahlil qilingan.

Keywords: movement, game, education, children, methodology, development, element.
Kirish. Bugungi kunda 5-7 yoshli bolalar uchun jismoniy tarbiya metodikasini
takomillashtirish zarurati, harakatli o‘yin elementlaridan foydalanish orqali yanada dolzarb
ahamiyat kasb etmoqda. Buning birinchi sababi bolalar salomatligini muhofaza qilish va
ularning jismoniy rivojlanishini ta`minlashdir. O‘sib borayotgan texnologik taraqqiyot, ayniqsa,
raqamli qurilmalar bilan uzviy bog‘liq bo‘lgan muhit, bolalarning jismoniy faoliyatini
pasaytirishga olib kelmoqda. Statistik ma`lumotlarga ko‘ra, jismoniy aktivlik etishmovchiligi
bolalarda semizlik, yurak-qon tomir kasalliklari va boshqa salomatlik muammolarini keltirib
chiqarishi mumkin.
212

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Ijtimoiy omillar ham muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Zamonaviy hayot sharoitlari, o‘zgaruvchan
oilaviy tuzilmalar va bolalarning ko‘proq vaqtini uyda o‘tkazishi, ularning jismoniy faolligini
pasaytirishi bilan bog‘liq. Shu sababli, harakatli o‘yinlar orqali bolalarni jismoniy faoliyatga
jalb qilish, ularni sog‘lom hayot tarziga rag‘batlantirishga xizmat qiladi. Harakatli o‘yinlar
bolalarda jamoaviylik, muloqot va ijtimoiy ko‘nikmalarni rivojlantirishga ham yordam beradi.
Shuningdek, iqtisodiy omillar ham ahamiyatga ega. O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti
tomonidan ilgari surilgan "Sog‘lom avlod" dasturi doirasida bolalar jismoniy tarbiyasini
rivojlantirishga qaratilgan investitsiyalar va resurslar ko‘paymoqda. Bu esa, o‘z navbatida,
harakatli o‘yinlarni pedagogik jarayonga joriy etish imkoniyatlarini kengaytirmoqda.
Bundan tashqari, ilmiy tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatmoqdaki, harakatli o‘yinlar orqali bolalar
nafaqat jismoniy, balki hissiy va ruhiy rivojlanish hamda kognitiv qobiliyatlarini oshirishda
samarali bo‘ladi. Shu sababli, 5-7 yoshli bolalar uchun jismoniy tarbiya metodikasini
takomillashtirish, harakatli o‘yin elementlarini qo‘shish orqali, bugungi kunda nafaqat
salomatlik, balki ta`lim va tarbiya jarayonining sifatini oshirishga xizmat qiladi.

mаshq qilish vositаsi bo‘lib xizmаt qilаdi. Odаmlаrning bаrchа fаoliyаti ikki turdаgi
mаnbаlаrdаn kelib chiqаdi: tаbiiy-orgаnik vа ijtimoiy-mаdаniy. Inson bu o‘zigа xos
funktsiyаlаri bo‘lgаn ko‘plаb а`zolаrdаn tаshkil topgаn murаkkаb orgаnizmdir. Hаr bir orgаn
tegishli fаoliyаtni tаlаb qilаdi. Ushbu tаlаbdаn norozilik butun orgаnizmning buzilishi vа yo‘q
bo‘lishigа olib kelаdi. Inson fаoliyаtining tаbiiy tаlаblаri soddа vа nisbаtаn oson qondirilаdi,
аmmo ijtimoiy-mаdаniy ehtiyojlаr murаkkаb vа qiyinchilik bilаn qondirilаdi.
Ijtimoiy-mаdаniy ehtiyojlаr judа muhim vа yoqimli fаoliyаt uchun vаqt vа energiyа
qoldirmаsdаn, insondаn mаshаqqаtli mehnаt tаlаb qilаdi. Bolаlаr ijtimoiymаdаniy ehtiyojlаrgа
qаrаgаndа tаbiiy-orgаnik ehtiyojlаr bilаn ko‘proq yаshаydilаr.
Ijtimoiy-mаdаniy ehtiyojlаrgа esа tа`lim orqаli erishilаdi. O‘z-o‘zigа tаqdim etilgаn
bolаlаr mаdаniy qobiqni tаshlаb, tаbiаtgа yаqinroq bo‘lishаdi. Orgаnik ehtiyojlаr vа so‘rovlаrni
qondirish bolаlаrdа judа oson, chunki ulаr, odаtdа, otа-onаlаri tomonidаn zаrur bo‘lgаn bаrchа
nаrsаlаr bilаn tа`minlаnаdi. Voyаgа yetgungа qаdаr bolаlаr o‘zlаrining bаrchа ehtiyojlаri bilаn
tа`minlаnishi kerаk, аks holdа ulаrdа rivojlаnish me`yoriy kechmаydi.
O‘yin o‘quvchi shаxsining rivojlаnishi bilаn chаmbаrchаs bog‘liq bo‘lib, аyniqsа, ulаrni
jаdаl rivojlаntirish vа ijtimoiylаshtirish bosqichidа аlohidа pedаgogik аhаmiyаtgа egа.
O‘yinlаrning o‘zigа xos xususiyаtlаri o‘quvchilаrni mustаqil rivojlаntirish umumiy vа mustаqil
rivojlаntirish, ijtimoiylаshtirish vositаsi sifаtidа xizmаt qilishidаdir.
O‘yin o‘quvchilаrni jаmoаgа kirishishlаrini tа`minlаydi. O‘yin orqаli o‘quvchilаr jаmiyаt
а`zolаri orаsidаgi munosаbаtlаrni o‘rgаnаdilаr vа uning me`yorlаrini o‘zlаshtirаdilаr. O‘yin
hаmkorlikdаgi fаoliyаtning yаgonа turi emаs, shuning uchun hаm, o‘yinlаr boshqа fаoliyаt
turlаri bilаn bir qаtordа, o‘quvchilаrning lаyoqаtlаrini to‘lаqonli tаrzdа ro‘yobgа chiqаrishgа
yo‘nаltirilаdi. O‘yinlаr аyniqsа o‘quvchilаrdаgi hаmjihаtlikdа ijod qilish lаyoqаtini ro‘yobgа
chiqаrishdа muhim o‘rin egаllаydi. Bu jаrаyondа o‘quvchilаr ijtimoiy munosаbаtlаr tizimigа
kirishаdilаr. Nаtijаdа, xulq-аtvor me`yorlаri vа insonlаr bilаn hаmjihаtlikdа yаshаsh
ko‘nikmаlаrini o‘zlаshtirаdilаr.
Ulаrning intellektuаl tаrаqqiyotini tа`minlаydi. Buning nаtijаsidа, o‘quvchilаr

аsoslаngаn hаmkorlik muhiti qаror topаdi.
Jismoniy tаrbiyа oldigа qo‘yilgаn vаzifаlаrni bаjаrishdа bаrchа o‘quv yurtlаri tа`lim
tizimidаgi yosh аvlodni jismoniy bаquvvаt, chаqqon, irodаli, vаtаnpаrvаrlik ruhidа tаrbiyаlаb
voyаgа yetkаzish uchun bolаlаrning eng kichik yoshidаn boshlаb milliy hаrаkаtli o‘yinlаr
vositаsi bilаn jismonаn sаlomаtlik «poydevorini qurish»ni аmаlgа oshirish mumkin.
Jismoniy tarbiya metodikasida harakatli o‘yin elementlaridan foydalanish, o‘z navbatida,
bir qator muammolarni keltirib chiqaradi va bu masalalar jismoniy tarbiya sifatini pasayishiga
214

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

olib kelishi mumkin. Birinchi muammo, bu metodikalar va o‘yinlar orqali bolalarning jismoniy
faolligini oshirishga qaratilgan dasturlarning yetarlicha ko‘pligi emasligidir. O‘zbekiston
Respublikasi ta`lim tizimida jismoniy tarbiya sohasida innovatsion yondashuvlarning
yetishmasligi, bolalarning jismoniy rivojlanishiga salbiy ta`sir ko‘rsatmoqda. Ma`lumotlarga
ko‘ra, 5-7 yoshli bolalarning 60 foizi jismoniy faoliyat bilan shug‘ullanishda yetarli darajada
faollik ko‘rsatmaydi.
Ikkinchi muammo, jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining malakasi va tajribasining yetarli
emasligidir. O‘qituvchilarning harakatli o‘yinlar va ularning pedagogik ahamiyati bilan
tanishmasligi, bu metodikalarni samarali qo‘llay olmaslikka olib keladi. Ushbu muammolarni
bartaraf etish zarur, chunki jismoniy tarbiya bolalarning nafaqat jismoniy, balki hissiy va
ijtimoiy rivojlanishiga ham ta`sir ko‘rsatadi. Bunday muammolarni hal qilish, bolalar uchun
sog‘lom va faol hayot tarzini shakllantirishga yordam beradi.
Shuningdek, bolalar orasida jismoniy faollikni oshirish, ularning kelajakdagi salomatlik
ko‘rsatkichlarini yaxshilashga xizmat qiladi. Tadqiqotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, jismoniy faol
bolalar, kelajakda kamroq sog‘liq muammolariga duch keladilar. Shuning uchun, mazkur
muammolarni hal qilish, jismoniy tarbiyani zamonaviy talablar asosida takomillashtirish
zarurdir.
Tadqiqotning yakuniy maqsadi, 5-7 yoshli bolalar uchun jismoniy tarbiya metodikasini
harakatli o‘yin elementlari orqali takomillashtirishdir. Ushbu maqsadga erishish jarayonida,
bolalar jismoniy rivojlanishi, ijtimoiy ko‘nikmalari va hissiy holatlari o‘rtasidagi muvozanatni
ta`minlashga qaratilgan innovatsion yondashuvlar ishlab chiqiladi. Tadqiqot jarayonida,
harakatli o‘yinlarning pedagogik qiymatini baholash va ularni jismoniy tarbiya dasturlariga
integratsiya qilishning samaradorligini o‘rganish nazarda tutilmoqda.
Natijada, tadqiqot bolalar jismoniy faolligini oshirish, ularning salomatlik
ko‘rsatkichlarini yaxshilash va ijtimoiy ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishga yordam beruvchi
metodikalar va materiallarning yaratilishiga olib kelishi kutilmoqda. Shuningdek, jismoniy
tarbiyada o‘qituvchilarning malakasini oshirishga qaratilgan tavsiyalar ishlab chiqish, bolalar
uchun yanada samarali va qiziqarli ta`lim muhitini yaratishga xizmat qiladi.
Mavzuning dolzarbligi, zamonaviy texnologik va ijtimoiy sharoitlar, shuningdek, bolalar
orasida jismoniy faollikni oshirish zarurligi bilan bog‘liq bo‘lib, tadqiqot muammolarini hal
qilish orqali sog‘lom avlodni tarbiyalashga xizmat qilishi mumkin. Bu jarayon, jismoniy tarbiya
metodikasini modernizatsiya qilish orqali, kelajak avlodning jismoniy va ruhiy salomatligini
ta`minlashga yordam beradi.
Tadqiqot davomida olingan asosiy natijalar, 5-7 yoshli bolalar orasida jismoniy faollik
darajasini oshirish va harakatli o‘yin elementlarining pedagogik samaradorligini ko‘rsatdi.
Tadqiqot natijalariga ko‘ra, o‘yinlar orqali jismoniy tarbiya dasturlariga qatnashayotgan
bolalarning faollik darajasi 35% ga oshdi. Bu, harakatli o‘yinlar orqali bolalar orasida jismoniy
faoliyatga bo‘lgan qiziqishning ortishini anglatadi.
215

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Shuningdek, tadqiqot davomida olingan ma`lumotlarga ko‘ra, jismoniy tarbiya darslarida
harakatli o‘yinlardan foydalanish natijasida bolalarning ijtimoiy ko‘nikmalari 40% ga
yaxshilangan. Bu ko‘rsatkich, bolalarning jamoaviy ishga qobiliyatini va muloqot qilish
ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishda harakatli o‘yinlarning samaradorligini tasdiqlaydi.
Tadqiqot natijalari, harakatli o‘yin elementlarini jismoniy tarbiya metodikasiga qo‘shish
orqali, bolalar jismoniy rivojlanishini, ijtimoiy qobiliyatlarini va hissiy holatlarini yaxshilashga
erishilayotganini ko‘rsatadi. Misol uchun, darsdan oldin va keyin olingan test natijalari,
bolalarning jismoniy tayyorgarlik darajasidagi o‘zgarishlarni aniq ko‘rsatib berdi: darslardan
oldin 60% bolalar normativlarga javob bermasa, darslardan keyin bu ko‘rsatkich 85% gacha
oshdi. Bunday ko‘rsatkichlar, tadqiqot maqsadlariga erishilganligini isbotlaydi va jismoniy
tarbiyani takomillashtirishda harakatli o‘yinlarning ahamiyatini ta`kidlaydi.
Xulosa. Tadqiqot natijalari, 5-7 yoshli bolalar uchun jismoniy tarbiya metodikasini
takomillashtirishda harakatli o‘yin elementlarining ahamiyatini ochib berdi. Olingan
ma`lumotlar, o‘yinlar orqali bolalarning jismoniy faollik darajasi 35% ga oshganini
ko‘rsatmoqda, bu esa ularning jismoniy rivojlanishiga ijobiy ta`sir ko‘rsatadi. Shuningdek,
ijtimoiy ko‘nikmalar 40% ga yaxshilanishi, jamoaviy ish va muloqot qilish qobiliyatlarining
oshganini anglatadi. Dars davomida harakatli o‘yinlardan foydalanish, bolalarning jismoniy
tayyorgarlik darajasini 60% dan 85% gacha oshirishga yordam berdi. Ushbu natijalar, jismoniy
tarbiyani zamonaviy talablar asosida takomillashtirish muhimligini va harakatli o‘yinlarni
pedagogik jarayonga qo‘shishning samaradorligini isbotlaydi. Bu jarayon, nafaqat bolalarning
salomatligini, balki ularning ijtimoiy va hissiy rivojlanishini ham ta`minlashga xizmat qiladi.

Abstrakt. This article explores the didactic and methodological foundations for
developing professional knowledge and skills in sports management among future physical
education teachers. It analyzes the concept of sports management, its role in education, and
modern approaches to enhancing relevant competencies in pre-service teachers. The paper also
highlights effective teaching strategies integrated into the educational process to achieve better
learning outcomes.
Keywords: sports management, physical education, teacher training, professional
competence, pedagogical methodology.
Kirish
Bugungi globallashuv va raqobat sharoitida sport sohasi nafaqat sog‘lom turmush tarzini
targ‘ib etuvchi vosita, balki kuchli iqtisodiy va ijtimoiy resurs sifatida qaralmoqda. Ayniqsa,
sport menejmenti — sport tashkilotlari, musobaqalar, klublar va infratuzilmani samarali
boshqarish bilan bog‘liq faoliyatlar tizimi — so‘nggi yillarda alohida dolzarblik kasb etmoqda.
Shu boisdan, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarida sport menejmenti bo‘yicha kasbiy bilim
va ko‘nikmalarni shakllantirish zamonaviy pedagogikaning muhim yo‘nalishlaridan biriga
aylanmoqda.
Oliy ta’lim tizimida sport menejmentiga oid bilimlarni egallagan pedagog kadrlar nafaqat
maktab va kollejlar miqyosida, balki sport tashkilotlari va jamiyatda ham faoliyat yuritishga
tayyor bo‘ladi. Mazkur maqolada aynan shu jarayon — ya’ni, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya
o‘qituvchilarini sport menejmenti sohasiga oid kompetensiyalar bilan ta’minlash metodikasi —
ilmiy-nazariy asosda ko‘rib chiqiladi.
Adabiyotlar tahlili
Bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarida sport menejmenti bo‘yicha kasbiy bilim va
ko‘nikmalarni shakllantirish masalasi zamonaviy pedagogika va menejment fanlari
chorrahasida joylashgan tadqiqot yo‘nalishidir. So‘nggi yillarda bu borada bir qator ilmiy ishlar,
metodik qo‘llanmalar va konseptual yondashuvlar paydo bo‘ldi.
Sport menejmentining nazariy asoslari Germaniya, AQSh, Rossiya va boshqa davlatlar
tajribasida keng o‘rganilgan. Jumladan, sport menejmenti tushunchasi, uning struktura va
funksiyalari haqida G.V.Sysoeva sport tizimida boshqaruv funksiyalari va rahbarlik uslublarini
tahlil qilgan [1]. Bu fikrlar menejerlik kompetensiyalarining ta’lim jarayoniga integratsiyasida
muhim asos bo‘la oladi.
Mahalliy olimlardan A.A.Jo‘rayevning fikriga ko‘ra, sport sohasidagi boshqaruv faoliyati
nafaqat nazariy bilim, balki amaliy ko‘nikmalarni talab qiladi. Ayniqsa, bo‘lajak
o‘qituvchilarda bu ko‘nikmalarni shakllantirish uchun interaktiv metodlar va loyihaviy
yondashuv samarali hisoblanadi [2].
Pedagogik jarayonda kasbiy kompetensiyalarni rivojlantirishga qaratilgan ilmiy
izlanishlar ham mavjud. Masalan, O.T.Muxamedov jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining kasbiy
tayyorgarligi darajasi ularning o‘quvchilarga samarali ta’sir ko‘rsatish qobiliyatiga bevosita
218

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

ta’sir ko‘rsatishini ta’kidlaydi [3]. Bu jihatlar sport menejmenti bo‘yicha bilimlarni ta’lim
jarayoniga tatbiq etishda ham o‘z aksini topadi.
Shuningdek, xalqaro tajribalarda sport menejmentining innovatsion yondashuvlari —
masalan, sport marketingi, media menejment, homiylik siyosati kabi yo‘nalishlar — talabalarda
tahliliy fikrlash va ijodiy yondashuvni shakllantiradi. T.J.Slack va L.Parent’ning asarlarida sport
tashkilotlari boshqaruvida strategik rejalashtirish va inson resurslarini boshqarish muhim jihat
sifatida ko‘rsatilgan [4].
Yuqoridagi manbalar tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki, bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarida
sport menejmentiga oid bilim va ko‘nikmalarni shakllantirishda integratsiyalashgan,
kompetensiyaviy yondashuv asosidagi metodik tizimlar eng samarali yo‘nalish hisoblanadi.
Metodologiya
Tadqiqotda nazariy va amaliy metodlar uyg‘unligidan foydalanildi. Birinchidan, sport
menejmenti va pedagogik kompetensiyalarni shakllantirishga oid ilg‘or xorijiy va mahalliy
manbalar tahlil qilindi. Bu jarayonda taqqoslash, tahlil va umumlashtirish usullari asosida ilmiy
asoslar ishlab chiqildi.
Amaliy bosqichda esa Andijon davlat jismoniy tarbiya va sport instituti hamda
pedagogika universitetlarining jismoniy madaniyat yo‘nalishidagi 3-4-bosqich talabalari
o‘rtasida so‘rovnoma, kuzatuv va eksperimentlar o‘tkazildi. Eksperimental guruhga sport
menejmenti bo‘yicha interaktiv va loyihaviy darslar tashkil etilib, nazorat guruhi bilan taqqoslab
baholandi.
O‘quvchilarning bilim darajasi, kompetensiyalarini shakllantirish holati maxsus
diagnostika kartalari asosida o‘lchandi. Natijalar statistik tahlil qilinib, samaradorlik
ko‘rsatkichlari chiqarildi.
Natijalar va muhokama
Tadqiqot davomida o‘tkazilgan tajriba-sinov darslari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, sport menejmenti
elementlarini dars jarayoniga to‘g‘ri integratsiyalash orqali talabalar:
menejmentga oid asosiy tushunchalarni puxta egallagan;
sport tashkilotlarini boshqarish jarayonida ro‘y beradigan muammolarni tahlil qilish va
hal qilish ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirgan;
jamoada ishlash, rejalashtirish va qaror qabul qilish kompetensiyalarini
mustahkamlashgan.
Eksperimental guruhda bilim va ko‘nikmalar shakllanishining yuqori darajasi kuzatildi.
Bu, ayniqsa, amaliy mashg‘ulotlar, keys-stadi va rolli o‘yinlar asosida o‘qitish metodikasi
samaradorligini ko‘rsatdi.
Shuningdek, talabalar sport menejmenti bilan bog‘liq kasbiy faoliyatga nisbatan ijobiy
munosabat bildirishdi, bu esa ularning kasbiy motivatsiyasi oshganligini tasdiqlaydi.
Xulosa.
Tadqiqot natijalari asosida quyidagi xulosalarga kelindi. Sport menejmenti bo‘yicha
kasbiy bilim va ko‘nikmalarni shakllantirish – bo‘lajak jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchilarining
219

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

umumiy kasbiy tayyorgarligida muhim omil hisoblanadi. Innovatsion metodlar (keys-stadi,
loyiha ishlari, muammoli vaziyatlarni yechish) orqali bilimlarni mustahkamlash samarali natija
beradi. Dars jarayonida menejment komponentlarini integratsiyalash kasbiy kompetensiyani
shakllantirishda ijobiy ta’sir ko‘rsatadi. Amaliy mashg‘ulotlarga asoslangan o‘qitish
talabalarning real hayotiy vaziyatlarda mustaqil fikrlash va harakat qilish ko‘nikmalarini
kuchaytiradi. Shu asosda, sport menejmenti bo‘yicha ta’limni jismoniy tarbiya yo‘nalishida
o‘qitish konsepsiyasini takomillashtirish zaruriyati mavjud.

Tаbiiy mаhsulotlаrdаn tаyyorlаngаn tаomlаr – fаstfud vа gаzlаngаn ichimliklаrdаn voz
kechish lozim.
Kun dаvomidа 4-5 mаhаl ovqаtlаnish – bolаlаr orgаnizmi energiyаni tez sаrflаydi,
shuning uchun ulаr doimiy rаvishdа to‘yimli ovqаt iste’mol qilishi kerаk.
Suv ichish – bolаlаrning orgаnizmi suvgа ehtiyoj sezаdi, shuning uchun yetаrli miqdordа
tozа suv ichishlаri muhim.
Jismoniy fаollik-mаktаbgаchа yoshdаgi bolаlаr doimiy hаrаkаtdа bo‘lishi lozim. Ochiq
hаvodа o‘ynаsh, yugurish, suzish vа boshqа jismoniy mаshg‘ulotlаr ulаrning muskullаrini
mustаhkаmlаydi vа immunitetini oshirаdi.
Bolаlаr tаbiаtаn hаrаkаtchаn bo‘lishаdi, shuning uchun ulаrning jismoniy fаolligini
rаg‘bаtlаntirish muhimdir. Bu quyidаgilаr orqаli аmаlgа oshirilishi mumkin:
Ertа yoshdаn boshlаb jismoniy mаshqlаr qilish (ertаlаbki bаdаntаrbiyа, yugurish,
o‘yinlаr), sport turlаri bilаn shug‘ullаnish (suzish, gimnаstikа, futbol, bаsketbol), ochiq hаvodа
ko‘proq vаqt o‘tkаzish (sаyr qilish, tаbiаt qo‘ynidа bo‘lish), hаrаkаtli o‘yinlаrni rivojlаntirish
(o‘yin orqаli jismoniy fаoliyаtni oshirish), jismoniy fаollik nаfаqаt sog‘liq uchun foydаli, bаlki
bolаlаrning ijtimoiy rivojlаnishigа, do‘stlik munosаbаtlаrini shаkllаntirishigа hаm yordаm
berаdi.
Gigiyenа qoidаlаrigа rioyа qilish-bolаlаrni gigiyenа qoidаlаrigа o‘rgаtish ulаrning
sog‘lom o‘sishi uchun muhimdir. Qo‘llаrni yuvish, tishlаrni to‘g‘ri pаrvаrish qilish, kiyimkechаk gigiyenаsi kаsаlliklаrning oldini olishgа yordаm berаdi.
Bolаlаrdа gigiyenа qoidаlаrigа rioyа qilish odаtini shаkllаntirish ulаrning sog‘lom
bo‘lishidа muhim o‘rin tutаdi. Quyidаgilаr аsosiy gigiyenа qoidаlаri hisoblаnаdi:

Qo‘llаrni yuvish – kаsаlliklаrning oldini olishdа eng muhim omillаrdаn biri.

Tishlаrni muntаzаm tozаlаsh – og‘iz gigiyenаsi sog‘liq uchun judа muhim.

Tаnа vа kiyim-kechаk gigiyenаsi – doimiy rаvishdа yuvinish vа tozа kiyim kiyish.

O‘yinchoqlаr vа аtrof-muhitni tozа sаqlаsh – bаkteriyаlаr vа viruslаrning
tаrqаlishini oldini olish.
Bolаlаr gigiyenа qoidаlаrini tushunib yetishi vа ulаrni odаt tusigа kiritishi uchun otаonаlаr vа tаrbiyаchilаr ulаrgа doimiy tushuntirish ishlаrini olib borishlаri kerаk.
Tinch vа sifаtli uyqu. Bolаlаr uchun sifаtli uyqu muhim аhаmiyаtgа egа. Mаktаbgаchа
yoshdаgi bolаlаr kunigа kаmidа 10-12 soаt uxlаshi lozim. Uyqu yetishmovchiligi bolаning
kаyfiyаti vа sog‘lig‘igа sаlbiy tа’sir ko‘rsаtishi mumkin.
Mаktаbgаchа yoshdаgi bolаlаr kunigа kаmidа 10-12 soаt uxlаshlаri lozim. Uyqu
yetishmovchiligi bolаning аqliy vа jismoniy rivojlаnishigа sаlbiy tа’sir ko‘rsаtishi mumkin.
Sifаtli uyqu uchun quyidаgi shаroitlаr yаrаtilishi kerаk:

Muаyyаn uyqu tаrtibigа rioyа qilish – hаr kuni bir vаqtdа yotish vа uyg‘onish.



Yotishdаn oldin gаdjetlаrdаn voz kechish – ekrаn nurlаri uyqugа sаlbiy tа’sir

qilаdi.

Yotishdаn oldin tinchlаntiruvchi muhit yаrаtish – ertаk аytib berish, sokin musiqа
eshitish.

Sifаtli uyqu bolаning energiyаsini tiklаydi, immunitetini mustаhkаmlаydi vа uning
аqliy fаolligini oshirаdi.
Ruhiy vа hissiy muhit-bolаning psixologik holаti uning umumiy rivojlаnishidа kаttа rol
o‘ynаydi. Otа-onаlаr vа tаrbiyаchilаr bolаgа mehr-muhаbbаt vа qo‘llаb-quvvаtlаsh muhitini
yаrаtishlаri kerаk. Stress vа аsаbiylik bolаning sog‘lig‘igа zаrаr yetkаzishi mumkin.
Bolаning ruhiy holаti uning umumiy sog‘lig‘igа bevositа tа’sir qilаdi. Stress, qo‘rquv vа
xаvotirlаr bolаning rivojlаnishini sekinlаshtirishi mumkin. Ruhiy bаrqаrorlikni tа’minlаsh
uchun:

Otа-onа vа tаrbiyаchilаr bolаgа e’tibor berishlаri

Bolаni mаqtаsh vа rаg‘bаtlаntirish

Tinch vа iliq muhit yаrаtish

Zo‘rаvonlik vа jаhl bilаn muomаlа qilishdаn qochish

Bolаgа o‘z his-tuyg‘ulаrini ifodаlаsh imkonini berish
Bolа o‘zini xаvfsiz vа himoyаlаngаn his qilgаnidа, u yаnаdа sog‘lom vа fаol bo‘lib
o‘sаdi.
Sog‘lom turmush tаrzi bolа orgаnizmini turli kаsаlliklаrdаn himoyа qilаdi, uning
immunitetini oshirаdi vа intellektuаl rivojlаnishigа ijobiy tа’sir ko‘rsаtаdi. Sog‘lom bolа fаol,
quvnoq vа bilim olishgа tаyyor bo‘lаdi. Bundаn tаshqаri, sog‘lom odаtlаr bolаlikdаn shаkllаnsа,
ulаr butun hаyot dаvomidа sаqlаnib qolаdi.

So‘ngi yillarda mamlakatimizda jismoniy tarbiya va ommaviy sportni rivojlantirishga
shuningdek, paralimpiya sport turlarini rivojlantirishga katta e`tabor qaratilmoqda. O‘zbekiston
respublikasi prezidentining 2017 yil 3 iyundagi PQ-3031-son qaroriga muvofiq O‘zbekiston
respublikasida jismoniy tarbiya va ommaviy sportni yanada rivojlantish chora tadbirlari
to‘g‘risidagi qarorlari mamlakatimizdagi ommaviy sportni yanada rivojlantirishga asos bo‘ladi.
Sportdagi yutuqlarnining o‘sib borishi har doim sportchidan jismoniy qobiliyatlar
rivojlanishning yangi darajasini talab qiladi. Qobiliyatlarni rivojlantirish maktab yoshidan
boshlansa kelajakda yuqori natijalarga erishishi yengillashadi. Bolalarning jismoniy
tayyorgarligi aniqlash ularning sog‘ligini mustahkamlash va jismoniy sifatlarini rivojlantishda
muhim qadam hisoblanadi.
Jismoniy tayyorgarlik tushunchasi va uning mohiyati haqida ko‘plab mualliflarimiz o‘z
fikrlarini bildirgan. Jismoniy tayyorgarlik – bu jismoniy sifatlarni rivojlantirish, zarur ko`nikma
va malakalarni o`zlashtirish bo`yicha bo`yicha maqsadga yo`naltirilgan holda
tashkillashtirilgan pedagogik jarayon natijasidir. U quyidagi asosiy sifatlarni o‘z ichiga oladi:
kuch, chadamlilik, koordinatsion, egiluvchanlik, tezkorlik. Ushbu sifatlarning rivojlanganlik
darajasi insonning jismoniy tayyorgarligini belgilaydi. Oxirgi vaqtda jismoniy tayyorgarlikning
konditsion va koordinatsion shakllari ajratilmoqda. Koordinatsion jismoniy tayyorgarlik
kordinatsion jismoniy sifatlarning rivojlanish darajasi bilan tavsiflanadi. Ular tarkibiga asosiy (
kuch, chidamlilik, egiluvchanlik, tezkorlik) va hosila (kuch chidamliligi, Tezkor chidamlilik,
Tezkor kuch qobilyatlari) sifatlar kiradi.
Koordinatsion jismoniy tayyorgarlik, birinchi navbatda, markaziy asab tizimi va
sensomator jarayonlarning xususiyatlari (muvozanatni namoyon qilish paytida va vestibulyar
funksiya) bilan belgilanadi. “Koordinatsiya” tushunchasi ( lotinchadan “coordinatsion” kelishish, birgalikda bo`ysunish, muvofiqlashtirish) harakatlarni boshqarish jarayonida ma’lum
bir harakatlarni o‘zaro moslashtirish qobiliyati sifatida belgilanadi. U muvozanat, reaksiya
qilish, fazoda mo`ljal olish, harakatlar parametrlarini tabaqalashtirish, bitta harakat amalidan

11-12 yoshli maktab o‘quvchilarining jismoniy tayyorgarligini milliy va harakatli
o‘yinlar orqali rivojlantirish. Jismoniy tayyorgarlik deganda biz eng avvalo 5 ta jismoniy
sifatlarni tushunamiz. Milliy va harakatli o‘yinlar ichidan jismoniy tayyorgarlikni oshiruvchi
hamda jismoniy sifatlarni rivojlantiruvchilarini tanlab tahlil qilindi. Jismoniy mashqlar inson
uchun, ayniqsa, o‘rta maktab bosqichida hayotiy zarur ko‘nikma va malakalarni shakllantirish
hamda dastlabki jismoniy tayyorgarlikni rivojlantirish uchun eng maqbul davr hisoblanadi.
Kam harakatsizlik bolani ijodiy faolligiga va yoshga xos jismoniy sifatlarini yetarli darajada
rivojlanmasligiga olib keladi.
Harakatni cheklash yoki uni buzish hayotiy zarur bo‘lgan qobiliyatlarni rivojlanishiga
salbiy ta’sir etadi. O‘yin uslubi jismoniy tarbiyada qo‘llaniladiga o‘yinlar uchun xos ko‘pgina
belgilarga ega. O‘yin nafaqat jismoniy tarbiyaning vositasi (ya’ni jismoniy mashqlarning o‘ziga

xos tizimlari bilan),balki tarbiya va ta’limning samarali uslubi hamdir. Shuning uchun o‘yin
uslubi tabiatini tushunish umuman o‘yinning mohiyatini tushunish demakdir.
Tadqiqot olib borish maqsadida 11-12 yoshli 12 nafardan 24 nafar o‘g‘il bolalar tanlab
olindi. Ularning jismoniy tayyorgarligini aniqlash hamda solishtirish uchun ikki guruhdan ham
alohida – alohida test me’yorlari olindi. Test me’yorlari aynan jismoniy tayyorgarlikni aniqlash
imkonini beruvchi, O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidentining 2021 yil 16 iyundagi PQ – 5148 –
sonli qaroriga muvofiq ishlab chiqilgan yosh toifalari bo‘yicha “jismoniy tayyorgarlik darajasi”

o‘yinlarni mashg‘ulot jarayonida qo‘llash yuqori samara berdi.
Xulosa qilib shuni aytish kerak-ki, milliy va harakatli o‘yinlar bolalarning jismoniy
qobiliyatlarini rivojlantirish hamda jismoniy tayyorgarligi oshirishda eng samarali uslubdir.
Chunki bolani jismoniy mashqlarga bo‘lgan qiziqishini oshirishda va tez zerikishni oldini
olishda muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Jismoniy qobiliyatlarni rivojlantirishga xizmat qiluvchi
milliy va harakatli o‘yinlarni mashg‘ulotlarda qo‘llash samarali usulligi aniqlandi. jadvallardan
ko‘rinib turibdiki, tadqiqot boshida tajriba guruhining natijalari nazorat guruhining natijalaridan
pastrog‘ edi. Tadqiqotdan so‘ng esa olingan natijalarga ko‘ra tajriba guruhining natijalari
nazorat guruhining natijalaridan yurori eknaligi ko‘rindi.

KIRISH
Universitetda jismoniy tarbiya o'quv jarayonining muhim qismi bo‘lib, u ijobiy ta'sir
ko‘rsatadi talabaning umumiy salomatligi. Maqolada jismoniy mashqlar (voleybol)
rivojlanishiga ta'siri ko‘rib chiqiladi jismoniy fazilatlar. Voleybol o‘ynash usullari va usullarini
takomillashtirish va rivojlantirishga qaratilgan mashqlar jismoniy sifatlar hozirgi davrda

dolzarb masala hisoblanadi. Shuning uchun maqolaning maqsadi mashqlarni ko‘rib chiqishdir
uning amalga oshirilishi voleybol o‘yiniga tayyorgarlik ko‘rishga yordam beradi va shu bilan
o‘quvchilarning jismoniy sifatiga ta'sir qiladi. Voleybol - jismoniy holati quyidagilar bilan
tavsiflangan sportchilar tomonidan shug‘ullanishi mumkin bo‘lgan sport turi. funktsional
talablarning yuqori va kuchli darajasi. Pulsografik tadqiqotlar natijalarini ko‘rib chiqqandan
so‘ng va sportchilarda kuzatilgan tana vaznining qatiy yo‘qolishi, voleybol bu sport turi
ekanligiga ishonch hosil qilish mumkin. Ko‘p sonli yuklar va mashg‘ulotlarning intensivligi
bilan tavsiflanadi.
Bu xususiyatlar yuqori talablarni qo‘yadi o‘yinda bevosita ishtirok etuvchi
o‘quvchilarning jismoniy holati.
Keyingi harakatlar strategiyasini o‘ylab, o‘yinchi diqqatini o‘yin ob'ektiga qaratadi,
vizual xotirani va voqelikni og‘zaki bo‘lmagan idrok qilishni o‘rgatadi. Shunday qilib, voleybol
bir vaqtning o‘zida jismoniy qobiliyatlarni ham, taktik fikrlashni ham rivojlantiradi. Voleybol
talaba yoshlar tanasining uchta fiziologik komponentini, ya'ni moslashuvchanlikni, nevrotizmni
va asab jarayonlari muvozanatining barqarorligini yaxshilashda ishtirok etadi. Voleybol
o‘ynash tezlikni va uning elementar shakllarini - reaktsiya vaqti, harakatlar chastotasi va o‘yin
davomida talabalarlarning harakat qilish tezligini rivojlanishiga yordam beradi.Bu haqiqat
professional sportchilarning 0,12 dan 0,18 gacha bo‘lgan oraliqda aks etadigan tezkor
reaktsiyasi va telegraf kaliti bilan ishlashda baholanishi mumkin bo‘lgan harakatlarning juda
yuqori chastotasi bilan ajralib turishi bilan tasdiqlanadi. Harakatning maksimal tezligi 10
soniyada 70-90 zarba oralig‘ida va ushbu testda boshqa sport turlari bo‘yicha sportchilarning
ko‘rsatkichlaridan oshib ketadi, bu asabiy jarayonlarning yuqori harakatchanligi va labilligini
ko‘rsatadi.
O‘yin o‘quvchilarning asab tizimida qo‘zg'alish va inhibisyon o‘rtasidagi muvozanatni
ta'minlaydi. Muvozanat faqat nerv jarayonlari teng ifodalanganda mavjud bo‘ladi. Asab
jarayonlari muvozanatda bo‘lgan odamlar muvozanatli xatti-harakatlar bilan ajralib turadi.
Talabalar vaqt va makonda aniq vaziyatga oid katta hajmdagi ma’lumotlarni shoshilinch
baholash, bu holatni mavjud tajribalari bilan solishtirish asosida o‘yin davomida taktik
masalalarni yechishlari kerak bo‘ladi.
Bunday holda, taktik muammolarni hal qilish ehtimollik xususiyatiga ega va o‘yinchi
turli xil echimlardan, uning fikricha, ijobiy natija ehtimoli ko‘proq bo'lganini tanlaydi. O‘yin
davomida talabalar orasida kosmosda muvofiqlashtirish, vizual idrok va diqqatlilik
ko‘rsatkichlari bilan bog‘liq bo‘lgan fikrlashning bunday xususiyatlari alohida o‘rin tutadi.
Amalda uzoq vaqtdan beri har qanday jismoniy mashg‘ulot o‘quvchining umumiy faolligi
va uning jismoniy va aqliy faoliyatini oshirishga ijobiy ta'sir ko‘rsatishi isbotlangan, buni
jismoniy faoliyatdan qochadigan va sportning har qanday turi bilan shug‘ullanadigan talabalar
haqida aytib bo‘lmaydi. Agar darslar chidamlilik, zukkolik, jamoaviy ruh va kuchning asosiy
rivojlanishiga qaratilgan bo‘lsa, bu fazilatlarning namoyon bo‘lishi sodir bo‘ladi va voleybol
sinfi davomida taktik kombinatsiyalar. Boshqacha qilib aytganda, talabalar nisbatan uzoq vaqt
235

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

davomida o‘qish davomida nisbatan yuqori darajadagi faollikni saqlab qolishlari kerak. Shunga
ko‘ra, butun mashg'ulot davrini kuch, chidamlilik, chaqqonlik, tezlik, moslashuvchanlik kabi
tananing yuqori darajada rivojlangan jismoniy sifatlarisiz tasavvur qilish qiyin. Ularning
barchasi alohida mushak guruhlari ishi uchun zarur bo‘lgan issiqlik energiyasini ishlab
chiqarishga hissa qo‘shadi. Faqat bu holatda motorli o‘yin harakatlari samarali namoyon
bo‘ladi.
Voleybol o‘yinida ishtirok etish - asabiy buzilishlarning oldini olish, haddan tashqari
tashvish, hissiy stress adachi bilan sharoitlar yaratilgan. Jadvalda tavsiflangan
komponentlarning kombinatsiyasi voleybolchilarning raqobatbardosh faoliyatida hissiy va
aqliy tartibga solishning alohida ahamiyatini ta'kidlaydi. Bu komponent o‘quvchining jamiyatda
o‘zini qanchalik yaxshi his qilishini, o‘zidan va hayotidan qanoatlanayotganligini, ijtimoiy
mavqeini ko‘rsatadi. Voleybol bu komponentni yaxshilaydi, bu esa talabaning aqliy
jarayonlarini tartibga solish qobiliyatiga olib keladi: uning fikrlarini, his-tuyg‘ularini, istaklarini
etarli darajada boshqarish; atrof-muhit bilan muloqot qilish va boshqalar bilan muloqot qilish
qobiliyati ham shakllanadi.Boshqa sport turlari singari voleybol ham o‘quvchilarda kompleks
birikmalarni bajarish qobiliyatini rivojlantiradi kombinatsiyalar, to‘satdan bog‘liq holda iloji
boricha samarali qaror qabul qilish qobiliyatini shakllantiradi. Oliy oʻquv yurtlari oʻqituvchilari
taʼkidlashicha, talabalar umumiy rivojlanish, kirish va maxsus mashqlar ularning tanasiga ijobiy
fiziologik ta'sir ko‘rsatadi. Shunday qilib, isinish paytida. Bu litsenziya shartlariga muvofiq
tarqatilgan ochiq kirish maqolasi. Ushbu litsenziya nusxasini ko‘rish uchun.
ADABIYOTLAR TAXLILI VA METODLAR.
Ushbu bo‘lim ko‘rsatdiki, jismoniy tarbiya o‘qituvchisi, murabbiy voleybol bo‘yicha
mashg‘ulotlarni rejalashtirishda ularni o‘rganiladigan fan vazifalaridan
kelib chiqib,
o‘quvchilar kontingenti bilan muvofiq ravishda tuzishi lozim. Vazifalar ishning har bir davri,
bir necha darslari, darsning qismlari va har bir jismoniy mashq uchun alohida qo‘yilishi lozim.
Murabbiy shu mashg‘ulot davomida hal qilinadigan vazifani qo‘yishni bilishi lozim. Shu bilan
birga keyingi darslarda hal qilinadigan ko‘proq vazifalarni amalga oshirishga tayyor bo‘lishi
kerak. Shuni esdan chiqarmaslik kerakki, o‘rgatish jarayonidagi bir mashg‘ulotda
3-4 ta
vazifani hal qilinadi. Bunda asosiy va ikkinchi darajali vazifalarni ajratish lozim.
Turli bosqichlarda o‘rgatish vazifalarini qo‘yish va amalga oshirishni
shug‘ullanuvchilarni yoshi va tayyorgarligiga mos ravishda olib borishni bilish
pedagogik mahoratni talab qiladi. Bu yerda shug‘ullanuvchilarda o‘rganadigan texnik
usul haqida tasavvur hosil qilish nazarda tutiladi (hikoya qilish, kinogrammalar va
videoyozuvlar ko‘rsatish va yana uni bajarishni harakat qilib ko‘rish).
NATIJALAR VA MUHOKAMA.
Soddalashtirilgan shartlar asosida o‘yin usullarini bajarish.
Bir qator o‘yin usullari voleybolda o‘zining murakkabligi bilan ajralib turadi. Shuning
uchun oldin soddalashtirilgan sharoitlarda ya’ni, boshlanishida setkasiz sherigi yordamida
qo‘shimcha jihozlardan foydalanish orqali o‘rganish tavsiya qilinadi.

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Bu bosqichda quyidagi o‘rgatish metodlaridan foydalanish maqsadga muvofiq.
Mashqlar qismlarini davomiy qo‘shib borish bilan qo‘shilgan mashqlar metodi;
Mashqlar detallarini tanlab olib bajarish bilan jamlangan mashqlar metodi.
O‘yinga yaqinlashtirilgan sharoitlarda texnik usullarni o‘rganish. Shug‘ullanuvchilar
texnik usullarni soddalashtirilgan sharoitlarda to‘g‘ri bajarishga o‘rganishgandan keyin
murabbiy mashqni bir qancha qiyinlash-tirish lozim. Misol uchun, to‘pni uzatishlar, podachalar
va hujum zarbalarini setka orqali bajarish.
MUHOKAMA.
Texnik usullarni guruhli mashqlarda va o‘yinda takomillashtirish. O‘qituvchi yoki
murabbiyni oldida turgan asosiy vazifa shuki, shug‘ullanuvchilarda sheriklari bilan guruhli va
jamoaviy mashqlarni birga harakatlanib bajarish malaka va ko‘nikmalarini hosil qilishdan
iboratdir.
Shug‘ullanuvchilar yordamchi mashqlarni katta qiziqish bilan bajaradilar. Ammo ba’zida
xatoga yo‘l qo‘yadilar. Bu esa keyinchalik texnikani buzilishiga olib kelishi mumkin. Shuning
uchun murabbiy bu mashqlarning bajarish texnikasiga alohida e’tibor qaratish va o‘z vaqtida
tuzatishlar kiritib borish lozim.
Shuni esdan chiqarmaslik lozimki, o‘yinda voleybolchilarga ko‘p marta sakrashlar, turli
harakatlar, yiqilish va bir vaqtni o‘zida uchayotgan to‘p bilan o‘zaro harakatlanishlarni bajarish
to‘g‘ri keladi. Yuklamalar hajmi esa juda yuqori. Agar shug‘ullanuvchila shunday yuklamalarni
bajarishga tayyorlanmasa, jarohatlar kelib chiqishi mumkin.
XULOSA
Tadqiqotlarimiz ko‘rsatdiki, voleybolchilarni tayyorlash jarayonida tizimli yondashishda
mashg‘ulotlar, musobaqalar va boshqa faktorlarning birligi ko‘zda tutiladi. Bu yerda
belgilangan davrda sportchi tayyorgarlik darajasini bilish (ko‘rsatkichlar kompleksi, sport
natijasi), tayyor-garlikning metod va vositalari majmuasini tanlab olish, trenirovkani tashkillash
va musobaqa taqvimi, sportchi faoliyati va hayotiy umumiy rejimini barcha komponentlarini
tashkillash juda muhimdir.
Voleybolchilarni tayyorlash jarayonida tizimli yondashishda trenirovkalar, musobaqalar va
boshqa faktorlarning birligi ko‘zda tutiladi. Bu yerda belgilangan davrda sportchi tayyorgarlik
darajasini bilish (ko‘rsatkichlar kompleksi, sport natijasi), tayyorgarlikning metod va vositalari
majmuasini tanlab olish, trenirovkani tashkillash va musobaqa taqvimi, sportchi faoliyati va
hayoti umumiy rejimini barcha komponent-larini tashkillash juda muhimdir.
Shuni ta’kidlab o‘tish kerakki, turli harakatlarni samaradorligi to‘pni olib o‘tish, to‘ldirma
to‘plarni uloqtirish va ilib olish bilan qo‘shib bajarilishida bo‘ladi. Bu mashqlar
harakatlanishida tezligini oshirish bilan bir qatorda boshqa maxsus sifatlarni rivojlantirishni
ta’minlaydi va voleybol to‘pi bilan bajariladigan vazifalarni sezilarli darajada yengillashtiradi.
Aniqlandiki, harakatlanishlarni shakllantirishda harakatli o‘yinlar ham muhim faktorlardan
hisoblanadi. Bu o‘yinlar zarur sifatlarni rivojlantirish bilan bir qatorda shug‘ullanuvchilarni

Ibn Sinoning fikricha, «Sog’liqni saqlashning asosiy tadbiri - badan tarbiyadir». «Tib
qonunlari» kitobning birinchi qismi inson salomatligini saqlash va uni rivojlantirishga
bag’ishlangan. Kitobda inson tanasi va uning a’zolari, insonni shakllantirish hamda uning
kamolotida yuz beradigan anatomik tuzilishlar, fiziologik va ruhiy jarayonlarning holati,
kasalliklarning kelib chiqish sabablari ilmiy jihatdan bayon qilingan.
Ibn Sino o‘z asarlarida jismoniy mashqlar kishining yoshiga, jinsiga, sog’lig’i,
salomatligiga va kasalligiga qarab, turlicha shakl va uslublarda o‘tkazish kerakligi haqidagi
tavsiyalari juda muhimdir. Ibn Sino faoliyati va tajribalari asosida bolalik, o‘smirlik, yigitlik va
qarilik davrlarida kishi jismoniy mashg’ulotga turlicha munosabatda bo‘lishi kerakligi
masalalari bo‘yicha alohida ko‘rsatmalar bergan. Bu ilmiy-pedagogik ta’lim merosi jahon
xalqlari jismoniy madaniyati rivojlanishiga katta hissa ko‘shgan.
Inson tanasi bilan ishlaydigan kasblardan biri jismoniy tarbiya kursi hisoblanadi. Chunki
mashg'ulotlarni noto'g'ri tashkil etish, uslubiy tamoyillardan noto'g'ri foydalanish, insonning
sog'lig'i va individual xususiyatlarini hisobga olmasdan o'quv yukining hajmi va intensivligini
rejalashtirish istalgan natijalarni bermaydi yoki hatto salomatlikka zarar etkazishi mumkin.
Sog'liqni saqlash sifatini aniqlashda asosiy rol madaniyatga, shu jumladan jismoniy
madaniyatga tegishli. Jismoniy tarbiya va sportda zamonaviy mutaxassis-professional
kadrlarning asosiy maqsadi, inson salomatligini mustahkamlash, jismoniy sog'lomlashtirishdir.
Jismoniy madaniyat asosida salomatlik mustahkamlanadi. Bu jismoniy sog'lomlashtirishga
yo'naltirilganlik tamoyilining asosiy mohiyatidir. Odamning sog'lig'i va funktsional holatini
ko'rinishi, yoshi, jinsi, ishlab chiqarish va ta'lim faoliyatidagi tabiatini hisobga olgan holda
motor rejimini optimallashtirish va jismoniy faoliyatni individuallashtirishga qaratilgan.
Jismoniy madaniyat, shubhasiz, xalq umumiy madaniyatining bir qismi va aksidir.
Jismoniy tarbiya umumiy ta'limning uzviy qismi, ijtimoiy-pedagogik jarayondir.
Salomatlik, inson tanasining shakllari va funktsiyalarining uyg'un rivojlanishi
mustahkamlashga qaratilgan, uning jismoniy qobiliyat va fazilatlar, kundalik hayotda va ishlab
chiqarish faoliyatida zarur bo'lgan vosita ko'nikmalari va ko'nikmalarini shakllantirish va
takomillashtirish, pirovardida, jismoniy rivojlanishga erishishni ta’minlaydi.
Sog'lom tanada sog'lom fikr. Ushbu salomatlik holatiga tana tizimlaridagi turli
organlarning uyg'unlikda ishlashishi bilan erishish mumkin. Masalan, jismoniy faoliyat motor
harakatlari asosida muvofiqlashtiriladi. Asab tizimining bir qismi bo'lgan miyadan harakatlar
buyrug'i keladi. Oziq-ovqatdan talab qilingan harakatlar va boshqa faoliyat uchun energiya
olinadi. Oziq-ovqat butunlay ovqat hazm qilish tizimining bir qismi ichakda hazm qilinadi. Qon
aylanish tizimining bir qismi bo'lgan yurak harakati orqali oziq-ovqat va kislorod tananing
barcha qismlariga yetib boradi. Darhaqiqat, tanani sog'lom saqlash uchun tananing ko'plab
organlar tizimlari yaxlit bir butun bo’lib ishlaydi. Anatomiya fani tibbiy-biologik fanlar
majmuasiga taalluqli. “Anatomiya” o‘quv fanining asosiy maqsadi, talabalarga organizm
haqida umumiy tushunchalar berish va odam tanasining ichki tuzilishi ya’ni tayanch-harakat
tizimi, muskullar, ovqat hazm qilish, nafas olish, qon aylanish, ayirish,ichki sekretsiya
241

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

bezlarining tuzilishi, ularni tavsiflash, organizmda joylashgan o’rni haqida ilmiy tushunchalar
berishdan iborat. Bundan tashqari barcha organlarning tuzilishi haqidagi ilmiy asoslangan
fikrlar, organlar va tizimlarning funksiyalari, shakli va rivojlanishi bilan bog'liq o'zgarishlar
umuman olganda inson tanasiga sport va jismoniy madaniyatning ta'siri haqida tanishtiradi.
Jismoniy tarbiya o’qituvchisi uchun tananing qismlarini va ularning barchasi birgalikda
qanday ishlashini tushunish muhimdir. Jismoniy tarbiya o'qituvchilari birinchi navbatda
salomatlik savodxonligi bo'yicha o’quvchilarga sog'lom odatlarini rivojlantirish uchun asos
yaratadilar.
Mashg'ulot paytida tanangiz duch keladigan ba'zi jismoniy ta'sirlarga to’xtalib o’tamiz.
Suyaklar. Suyak zichligi balog'at yoshida maksimal darajaga yetadi so'ngra u pasayishni
boshlaydi, mashg'ulotlar aslida bo'g'inlar va suyaklarga ijobiy ta'sir ko'rsatadi. Harakatsizlik
suyaklarni mo'rtlashishiga olib keladi - jismoniy mashqlar suyak massasini ko'paytirishga
yordam beradi va suyak kasalliklari va bo'g'imlarning zaifligini oldini oladi.
Qon oqimi. Shunday qilib, siz jismoniy mashqlar haqida gap ketganda "qoningizni
haydash" iborasini eshitgansiz, lekin bu nimani anglatadi? Xo'sh, siz mashq qilayotganingizda,
qon oqimi eng zarur bo'lgan joylarga yo'naltiriladi, ya'ni mushaklarga bu erda kislorodning
ko'payishi va chiqindilar va kislota birikmalarining kamayish samaradorligini oshiradi. Mashq
qilish qon tomirlarining devorlarini bo'shashtirishga yordam beradi, bu esa periferik qarshilikni
kamaytirishga va qon bosimini pasaytirishga yordam beradi. Qon tomirlarining elastikligini
yaxshilaydi.
Miya funksiyasi. Sport nafaqat jismoniy salomatlik va tana go'zalligini saqlash usuli, balki
miyani rivojlantirish va mustahkamlash uchun ajoyib vositadir. Miya faoliyatiga asosiy
ta'siridan biri bu qon ta'minotini yaxshilashdir. U miyadan to'planishi va uning faoliyatiga salbiy
ta'sir ko'rsatishi mumkin bo'lgan chiqindilar va toksinlarni olib tashlaydi. Muntazam jismoniy
faoliyat miya faoliyatining turli jihatlariga ijobiy ta'sir ko'rsatadi - xotira, diqqat, kayfiyat,
o'rganish, ijodkorlik. Muntazam jismoniy mashqlar miyada, ayniqsa xotira, diqqat va boshqa
kognitiv funktsiyalar uchun mas'ul bo'lgan joylarda yangi qon tomirlarining o'sishini
rag'batlantiradi. Shunday qilib, sport miyaning samaradorligini oshiradi va uni qarishdan
himoya qiladi.
Yurak funksiyasi. Bu inson salomatligining asosidir. Harakatsiz turmush tarzi odatiy
holga aylangan zamonaviy dunyoda yurak va qon tomir kasalliklari o'limning asosiy sababiga
aylandi. Biroq, yurak sog'lig'ini saqlashning oddiy va samarali usuli bor - muntazam jismoniy
mashqlar. Tez-tez jismoniy faollik bilan yuragingiz tanadagi eng samarali joylarga ko'proq qon
quyishi yaxshilanadi. Bu yurak urish tezligi past bo'lgan qonning yanada samarali
taqsimlanishini anglatadi, bu tez-tez jismoniy mashqlar bo'lmagan tanada deyarli imkonsiz
narsa. Jismoniy mashqlar va sport ateroskleroz rivojlanishiga qarshi profilaktika, qon bosimi va
xolesterin darajasini normallashtiradi. Ayniqsa yurish, suzish, engil yugurish, velosiped,
konkida uchish va chang'i uchish, raqs, tennis, aerobika va boshqalar yurak faoliyaini
yaxshilaydi. To'g'ri kuch mashqlari yurak mushaklarining chidamlilikka o'rgatadi. Jismoniy
242

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

faollik yurakka salbiy ta'sir ko'rsatishi mumkin bo'lgan kortizol kabi stress gormonlari darajasini
pasaytiradi.
O'pka sig'imi. Jismoniy mashqlar o'pka salomatligini saqlash va yaxshilashda muhim rol
o'ynaydi. Jismoniy faollik o'pkaning umumiy hajmini oshirishga yordam beradi va ularning
elastikligini yaxshilaydi. Bu o'pkada gazlar - kislorod va karbonat angidridni samaraliroq
almashish imkonini beradi. Jismoniy nafas olish chuqurligini oshiradi, bu qonga kislorodning
samaraliroq yetkazilishiga va karbonat angidridni olib tashlashga yordam beradi. Aerob va kuch
mashqlari kabi turli xil mashqlar nafas olish mushaklarini kuchaytirishga yordam beradi, nafas
olishni samaraliroq va energiyani tejaydi. Surunkali bronxit kabi surunkali nafas olish
kasalliklarini rivojlanish xavfini kamaytirishga yordam beradi. Shuni esda tutish kerakki,
o'pkasi sog'lom bo'lganlar va ayniqsa nafas olish yo'llari bilan bog'liq muammolar mavjud
bo'lganlar uchun jismoniy faollikni ularning individual imkoniyatlarini hisobga olgan holda
boshlash tavsiya etiladi.
Mushaklar. Mushaklar tanadagi barcha harakatlarni boshqaradi.Jismoniy mashqlar
paytida kislorodga bo'lgan ehtiyoj keskin oshadi, shuning uchun mushak tizimi qanchalik faol
ishlasa, o'pka va yurak shunchalik faol ishlaydi. Mushaklaringiz harakatga kelganda, ular
ko'proq kislorod talab qiladi va qon tomirlari bu qabul qilish uchun kengayadi. Mushaklar
faoliyati qon aylanishiga, suyaklarning rivojlanishiga va shakliga ta'sir qiladi. Shunday qilib,
jismoniy faoliyat ta'sirida, mushaklarning kuchi ortadi. Jismoniy ishlarni bajarish qobiliyati,
chidamlilik mushak tizimini faoliyati natijasidir. Mushaklar qon aylanishida ishtirok etadi,
qonning kirib kelishi va chiqishiga yordam beradi. Mushaklarni periferik “yuraklar" deyish
mumkin. Chunki harakat va uning yetishmasligi barcha tizimlar va organlarga bevosita ta'sir
qiladi. Mushaklar va skelet inson tanasining shaklini belgilaydi. Balanslangan ovqatlanish va
jismoniy mashqlar mushak to'qimalarining rivojlanishiga yordam beradi va yog’
to’qimalarining hajmini kamaytiradi.
Hazm funksiyasi. Jismoniy mashqlar ovqat hazm qilish tizimi orqali oziq-ovqat harakatini
rag'batlantirishga yordam beradi, shuningdek, ich qotishi alomatlarini kamaytirishga yordam
beradi. Jismoniy mashqlar paytida mushaklaringiz qisqaradi, bu esa ovqatni ovqat hazm qilish
tizimidan o'tkazishga yordam beradi. Bu ich qotishining oldini olishga va ovqat hazm qilish
tizimining normal ishlashiga yordam beradi. Jismoniy mashqlar me'da shirasining ishlab
chiqarilishini oshiradi, bu ovqatni parchalash va uni to'g'ri hazm qilishga yordam beradi,
ichaklar hajmini oshirishga yordam beradi, bu oziq-ovqatdan ozuqa moddalarini o'zlashtirish
qobiliyatini yaxshilaydi. Stress ovqat hazm qilishni buzishi mumkin, ammo jismoniy mashqlar
stress darajasini pasaytirishga va ularni nazorat ostida saqlashga yordam beradi.
Anatomiya fani fundamеntal fanlar qatoriga kiradi, uni har tomonlama mukammal
o'rganish va bilish har bir jismoniy tarbiya o’qituvchisi uchun juda muhim. Chunki jismoniy
tarbiya o’qituvchilari ham odam tanasi bilan ishlaydilar. Shunday ekan odam organizmini
yaxshi bilish salomatlik va sog’lom turmush tarzini asosini belgilaydi. Anatomiya fanida
talabalar asosiy tana tizimlari va ularning sog'lik, jismoniy tayyorgarlik va jismoniy faoliyat
243

hamda sportdagi ishlashga qanday ta'sir qilishlari haqida bilim va tushunchalarni
rivojlantirishlari kerak. Anatomiyaning ahamiyatini biz quyidagi yo’nalishlarda ko’rib
chiqamiz.
1.Sport jarohatlarining oldini olishda yordam: bukilish, taranglik, kontuziya, sinish va
bo'g'imlarning chiqib ketishi kabi sport jarohatlarini olish o'yin va sport sohasida keng tarqalgan
hodisadir. Umuman olganda, har bir sportchi sport faoliyati davomida har qanday sport jarohati
qurboni bo'lishi mumkin.
2. Sportni tanlashda yordam: Odam anatomiyasi sportni tanlashda yordam beradi. Buning
asosiy sababi shundaki, har xil sport turlari mavjud. Sport har xil turdagi anatomik tuzilishni
talab qiladi, boshqa sport turlari esa boshqa turdagi anatomik tuzilishni talab qilishi mumkin
3. Reabilitatsiyada yordam: Biz hammamiz bilamizki, o'yinlar va sport sohasidagi
jarohatlar tabiiy ravishda. Reabilitatsiya jarayoni orqali jarohat olgan o'yinchi yana sportda
yaxshi natijalarga erisha oladi. Biroq, reabilitatsiya jarayoni barcha turdagi jarohatlar uchun
muhim emas. Inson anatomiyasini bilish samarali reabilitatsiya jarayoni uchun juda muhimdir
4. Mashg'ulot dasturini tuzishga yordam: Inson anatomiyasi bo'yicha tegishli bilimlar
yordamida turli sportchilar uchun yaxshi o'quv dasturlari tayyorlanishi mumkin. Jismoniy
tarbiya o'qituvchilari yoki murabbiylari anatomiyadan asosiy bilimlari bo'lsa, o’quvchilari
uchun yaxshi o'quv dasturlarini tayyorlay oladilar.
5. Jismoniy mashqlar paytidagi kimyoviy o'zgarishlarni bilishga yordam: Biz o'yin va
sport bilan shug'ullanayotganimizda yoki mashqlarni bajarganimizda, tanamizda bir qator
kimyoviy o'zgarishlar sodir bo'ladi. Bunday kimyoviy o'zgarishlar haqidagi bilimga faqat inson
fiziologiyasi orqali erishish mumkin.
6. Sport massajida yordam: Inson anatomiyasi haqidagi bilimlar sport massajini
bajarishda yordam beradi. Darhaqiqat, sport massaji yumshoq to'qimalarda muvozanatni
to'g'irlash yoki o'rnatish uchun ishlatiladi, ular odatda og'ir jismoniy faoliyatni qayta-qayta
bajarish natijasida muvozanat buziladi.
7. Birinchi yordam ko'rsatishda yordam: Kundalik mashg'ulotlar va musobaqalar paytida
jarohat olish tabiiydir. Agar o'sha paytda yaradorga birinchi yordam to'g'ri ko'rsatilmasa, oqibati
o'limga olib kelishi mumkin. Birinchi yordamchi tananing turli tizimlarining barcha a'zolari
haqida to'g'ri bilimga ega bo'lishi kerak, shundan keyingina birinchi yordamni to'g'ri ko'rsatish
mumkin.
Xulosa. Jismoniy tarbiya vositalaridan kompleks foydalanish orqaligina tananing
funktsional holatini, moslashuvchan potensialini va zaxiralarini oshirish mumkin. Ta'lim
muassasalari o'qituvchilarining ko'pchiligida o'quvchilarning sog'lig'i holatini diagnostika qilish
va turli darajadagi salomatlik darajasiga ega bo’lgan bolalar bilan o'quv-tarbiyaviy ishlarni
tashkil etish bo'yicha maxsus bilim va ko'nikmalarning yetishmasligi ham salomatlik holatining
yanada og'irlashtiradi. Bo’lajak jismoniy tarbiya o’qituvchilariga anatomiya fani o‘rganish bilan
inson organizmida muntazam jismoniy faoliyatga moslashish jarayonida sodir bo‘ladigan
somato-fiziologik o‘zgarishlarni tushunish va ilmiy asoslash uchun asos bo‘lib xizmat qiladi.

TADQIQOT METODOLOGIYASI: Ushbu tadqiqotda o‘quvchilarni basketbol sport
to‘garaklariga jalb etishning ilmiy, nazariy va amaliy asoslarini aniqlash va takomillashtirishga
qaratilgan kompleks yondashuv qo‘llanildi. Ilmiy izlanish quyidagi metodologik
yondashuvlarga tayanadi:
Tadqiqot ob’ekti va predmeti:Tadqiqot ob’ekti sifatida umumta’lim va sport
maktablari sharoitida tashkil etilgan basketbol to‘garaklari faoliyati olindi. Tadqiqot predmeti
esa-o‘quvchilarni ushbu to‘garaklarga jalb etish mexanizmlari, motivatsiya omillari va
samaradorlik ko‘rsatkichlari hisoblanadi.
Tadqiqotning maqsadi:Basketbol to‘garaklariga o‘quvchilarni jalb qilishda ilmiy
asoslangan metodlardan foydalanish orqali ularning jismoniy va psixologik rivojlanishini
ta’minlash hamda to‘garaklar samaradorligini oshirish yo‘llarini ishlab chiqish.
Tadqiqot usullari:Nazariy tahlil: ilmiy adabiyotlar, me’yoriy hujjatlar, ilg‘or tajribalar
o‘rganildi (Sh.N.Tuxtapulatov, K. Karimov,N.S. Safarboyev, B.Miradilov, F, Ganieva,
O.Eshberdiev, Nurse Nick, Sokolove Michael. Rapture: Fifteen Teams, Four Countries,
Hankinson Mel, Harvey Marvin, Joyce II Dru,).
Empirik usullar: so‘rovnoma, suhbat, kuzatuv orqali to‘plangan ma’lumotlar tahlil
qilindi.
Eksperimental usul: ayrim maktablarda sinov tariqasida tashkil etilgan basketbol
to‘garaklarida qatnashuvchilar soni, ularning davomat ko‘rsatkichlari va qiziqish darajasi
kuzatildi.
Statistik tahlil: to‘plangan ma’lumotlar matematik-statistik usullar asosida (foizli
nisbatlar, korrelyatsion tahlil) qayta ishlanib, natijalari grafik va jadval ko‘rinishida taqdim
etildi.
247

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Tadqiqot bazasi: Samarqand viloyatidagi 5 ta umumta’lim maktabi va 2 ta sport maktabi
eksperimental maydon sifatida tanlab olindi. Unda 11–15 yosh oralig‘idagi 200 nafar o‘quvchi
ishtirok etdi.
Tadqiqotning ilmiy yangiligi: O‘quvchilarni sport to‘garaklariga jalb etishning yangi
motivatsion modeli ishlab chiqildi. Ushbu model yosh sportchilar ehtiyojlari, ijtimoiy muhit va
psixopedagogik omillarni hisobga olgan holda ishlab chiqildi.
Tadqiqot muhokamasi: O‘tkazilgan tadqiqotlar natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, basketbol
sport to‘garaklariga o‘quvchilarni jalb qilishda asosiy omillar sifatida quyidagilar ajralib turadi:
o‘qituvchi-murabbiylarning yetarli pedagogik-mahorati, mashg‘ulotlarning mazmunli va
qiziqarli tashkil etilishi, o‘quvchilar orasida sportga bo‘lgan motivatsiyaning kuchli bo‘lishi,
ota-onalarning qo‘llab-quvvatlashi hamda sport infratuzilmasining mavjudligi.
So‘rovnoma natijalariga ko‘ra, o‘quvchilarning 62 foizi basketbol to‘garagiga qatnashish
istagini bildirgan, biroq ulardan 35 foizi maktabda zaruriy sport anjomlari yoki malakali
murabbiy yetishmasligini muammo sifatida ko‘rsatgan. Kuzatuvlar asosida aniqlanishicha,
darsdan keyingi to‘garaklar zamonaviy didaktik o‘yinlar, musobaqa elementlari,
rag‘batlantirish usullari bilan boyitilganda o‘quvchilar qatnashuvi va faol ishtiroki 1,6 barobar
oshgan.
Eksperimental maktablarda to‘garak faoliyati joriy etilganidan so‘ng 3 oy davomida
o‘quvchilarning jismoniy faolligi, davomat ko‘rsatkichlari va ijtimoiy faolligi ortgani kuzatildi.
Xususan, 5-sinflarda 20 foiz, 6–7-sinflarda esa 28 foizga yaqin qatnashuvchilar sonining ortishi
qayd etildi. Bu esa basketbol to‘garaklarini tashkil etish jarayonida metodik yondashuvlar,
motivatsion dasturlar va individual yondashuvlarning yuqori samara berishini isbotlaydi.
Muhokama jarayonida shuningdek, ilg‘or xorijiy tajribalar tahlil qilindi.
AQSh,
Yaponiya va Skandinaviya davlatlarida sport to‘garaklariga jalb etish tizimi psixologik
portretlar asosida amalga oshirilayotgani, o‘quvchilar qiziqishidan kelib chiqqan holda shaxsiy
rivojlanish dasturlari tuzilayotgani aniqlandi. Ushbu yondashuvlarning ayrim jihatlarini
mahalliy sharoitga moslashtirish orqali o‘zbek maktablarida sport to‘garaklarining sifatini
oshirish mumkinligi ta’kidlandi.
Umuman olganda, basketbol sport to‘garaklariga o‘quvchilarni jalb qilish
samaradorligini oshirish uchun kompleks yondashuv, pedagogik monitoring, rag‘batlantirish
tizimining mavjudligi va ota-onalar bilan hamkorlik zarurligi aniqlashtirildi.

Bu ko‘rsatkich o‘quvchilar orasida basketbolga bo‘lgan yuqori motivatsiya mavjudligini
tasdiqlaydi.
Qatnashishga bo‘lgan to‘sqlar:35% o‘quvchi sport anjomlarining yo‘qligini muammo
sifatida ko‘rsatgan.
30% o‘quvchi esa malakali murabbiy yetishmasligini asosiy to‘siq deb hisoblagan.
Yana 35% boshqa omillarni, jumladan, ota-onalari ruxsat bermasligini, vaqt tanqisligi
yoki
o‘zida

bildirgan.
Bu ma’lumotlar sportga bo‘lgan qiziqish yuqoriligiga qaramay, tashkiliy va ijtimoiy omillar
ishtirokni cheklayotganini ko‘rsatadi.
Zamonaviy metodlardan foydalanish natijasi:Basketbol to‘garaklarida didaktik
o‘yinlar, musobaqaviy elementlar va mukofot tizimi joriy etilgach, qatnashuv darajasi 1,6
barobar,
ya’ni
60%

Bu holat o‘quvchilarning sportga jalb qilinishida motivatsion yondashuvlar va innovatsion
pedagogik metodlar muhim o‘rin tutishini ko‘rsatadi.
Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, Samarqand viloyatidagi maktablarda o‘quvchilarni
basketbol to‘garaklariga jalb etish bo‘yicha salohiyat yetarli, lekin bu salohiyatdan to‘liq
foydalanish uchun quyidagi omillar muhim:
Material-texnik bazani mustahkamlash;
Malakali murabbiylar bilan ta’minlash;
Rag‘batlantiruvchi, qiziqarli va tizimli mashg‘ulotlar tashkil etish.

Ushbu jadval AQSh va O‘zbekiston maktablaridagi sport to‘garaklarini tashkil etish,
o‘quvchilarni jalb etish va motivatsiyalash tizimlarini strukturaviy hamda sonli ko‘rsatkichlar
asosida solishtiradi. Jadvalda har bir yondashuv mezoni bo‘yicha raqamli farqlar aniq
ko‘rsatilgan bo‘lib, ikki tizim o‘rtasidagi tafovutni samarali tahlil qilish imkonini beradi.
Jalb qilish yondashuvi:AQShda sport to‘garaklariga psixologik va ijtimoiy
ehtiyojlar asosida individual yondashuv qo‘llanilmoqda.
O‘zbekistonda esa yondashuv ko‘proq umumiy mashg‘ulotlar shaklida, ixtiyoriy
qatnashuvga asoslangan.
Psixologik portretga asoslangan yondashuv va rivojlanish dasturlari: AQShda bu tizim
mavjud (1 ball), O‘zbekistonda esa keng joriy etilmagan (0 ball).
Farq: 1 ball. Bu shuni ko‘rsatadiki, AQShda har bir o‘quvchining individualligi inobatga
olinadi, O‘zbekistonda esa bu imkoniyat hali shakllanmagan. Murabbiylarning malaka
darajasi:AQShda oliy sport ta’limiga ega murabbiylar ulushi 95% ni tashkil etsa, O‘zbekistonda
bu ko‘rsatkich 45% atrofida.
Farq: 50%, bu esa pedagogik sifat darajasida jiddiy tafovut borligini anglatadi.
Sport infratuzilmasi:AQShda maktablarning 90% sport zallari bilan jihozlangan bo‘lsa,
O‘zbekistonda bu ko‘rsatkich 30% atrofida.
Farq: 60%. Bu sportga bo‘lgan infratuzilmaviy yondashuvlar farqini ko‘rsatadi.
Monitoring tizimi mavjudligi:AQShda sport to‘garaklarida qatnashuv bo‘yicha doimiy
monitoring tizimi mavjud, bu holat O‘zbekistonda mavjud emas.
Farq: 1 ball – tizimlashtirilgan tahlil va boshqaruv jihatidan ustunlik AQSh tomonida.
Motivatsion tizimlar soni:AQShda o‘quvchilarni rag‘batlantirish uchun 5 turdagi asosiy
tizim mavjud: stipendiya, grant, musobaqa mukofotlari, ota-ona ishtiroki, murabbiylar bonusi.
O‘zbekistonda esa bu raqam 2 tur bilan cheklangan (asosan ustoz tashabbusi va ba’zida
sovg‘a-salomlar).
Farq: 3 tizim, ya’ni motivatsiya sifati va imkoniyati jihatdan AQSh ancha oldinda.
Qonuniy va moliyaviy qo‘llab-quvvatlash:AQShda federal va shtat darajasida qonuniy
asoslar mavjud (1 ball), O‘zbekistonda esa bunday huquqiy tizim hali to‘liq shakllanmagan (0
ball).
Farq: 1 ball – bu esa tizimiy mustahkamlikda sezilarli tafovut borligini bildiradi.
XULOSA

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

O‘tkazilgan ilmiy-empirik tadqiqotlar va xorijiy tajriba tahlillari asosida quyidagilar
aniqlandi: basketbol sport to‘garaklariga o‘quvchilarni jalb qilish samaradorligi bir qancha
muhim omillarga bog‘liq bo‘lib, ular ichida eng asosiylari – malakali murabbiylar ishtiroki,
zamonaviy pedagogik usullarning qo‘llanilishi, sport infratuzilmasining mavjudligi, ota-onalar
bilan samarali hamkorlik va o‘quvchilarda sportga bo‘lgan ijobiy motivatsiyani
shakllantirishdan iborat.
Samarqand viloyatidagi 7 ta maktab (5 ta umumta’lim va 2 ta sport maktabi) misolida
olib borilgan eksperimental tadqiqotlar natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, zamonaviy didaktik
yondashuvlar (musobaqa uslubi, rag‘batlantirish tizimi, o‘yinli metodlar) joriy etilgach,
o‘quvchilarning to‘garaklardagi faolligi 1,6 barobar, ya’ni 60 foizga oshgan. Bu esa yangi
yondashuvlar asosida tashkil etilgan basketbol to‘garaklari o‘quvchilarning nafaqat jismoniy,
balki ijtimoiy-psixologik faolligini ham oshirishda muhim vosita bo‘lishi mumkinligini
isbotlaydi.
Shuningdek, AQSh, Yaponiya va Skandinaviya davlatlarining ilg‘or tajribasi asosida
aniqlanishicha, o‘quvchi psixotipini inobatga olgan holda tuzilgan shaxsiy rivojlanish
dasturlari, individual monitoring va motivatsion strategiyalar sport to‘garaklarining
natijadorligini sezilarli darajada oshiradi. AQSh va O‘zbekiston o‘rtasidagi tizimiy solishtirma
tahlil ham shuni tasdiqlaydiki, O‘zbekistonda sport to‘garaklarining tashkiliy-huquqiy,
infratuzilmaviy va pedagogik asoslarini takomillashtirish orqali mavjud salohiyatdan
samaraliroq foydalanish mumkin.
Umuman olganda, basketbol sport to‘garaklarining samarali faoliyat yuritishi uchun
quyidagi chora-tadbirlarni amaliyotga joriy etish zarur:
Maktablarda sport anjomlari va infratuzilmani yaxshilash;
Murabbiylar malakasini muntazam oshirish va ularni rag‘batlantirish;
O‘quvchilarning psixologik ehtiyojlarini hisobga olgan holda motivatsion va individual
yondashuvlarga asoslangan metodikani ishlab chiqish;
Sport to‘garaklari monitoringini yo‘lga qo‘yish va ota-onalar ishtirokini kuchaytirish;
Qonuniy va moliyaviy asoslar bilan tizimni qo‘llab-quvvatlash.
Ushbu tavsiyalar asosida maktab sport to‘garaklari faoliyatining sifat darajasini yangi
bosqichga ko‘tarish, yosh avlodda sog‘lom turmush tarzini qaror toptirish, iqtidorli sportchilarni
erta aniqlash va rivojlantirishga xizmat qiladi.

Kirish: Maxsus ilmiy-metodik adabiyotlar ma'lumotlarini tahlil qilish shuni ko‘rsatdiki,
mashg'ulotlar va musobaqa faoliyatini boshqarish sportchi va butun jamoaning holatini aks
ettiruvchi ob'ektiv mezonlar asosida amalga oshirilishi kerak. O‘z tadqiqotlari shuni ko‘rsatdiki,
zamonaviy murabbiylar malakali voleybolchilarning yuqori sport mahoratini oshirish va
erishish uchun mashg'ulot jarayonining o‘ziga xosligini va o‘yin faolligini tavsiflovchi
informatsion ko‘rsatkichlarni tahlil qilishga nisbatan salbiy munosabatda bo‘lishadi. Tahlil
natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki malakali voleybol jamoalarining o‘yin faoliyati bitta o‘yinda
yakuniy natijaga erishishni aniqlaydigan turli xil texnik va taktik usullardan foydalanishdan
iborat. Voleybolda musobaqa o‘yinni tugatishning oltita variantini o‘z ichiga oladi. Jamoalar
o‘yinda 3:0, 3:1 va 3:2 hisoblarida g‘alaba qozonish, shuningdek, 0:3, 1:3 va 2:3 hisoblarida
mag‘lubiyatga uchragan holda g‘olib bo‘lishlari mumkin.
Aniqlanishicha, butun o‘yin mavsumi davomida o‘rganishda ishtirok etayotgan malakali
voleybol jamoalari turli xil ijobiy va salbiy natijalarni ko‘rsatishadi. Ta'kidlash joizki, o‘yin
mavsumida malakali voleybol jamoalari o‘yinning yakuniy natijalarini teng taqsimlaydilar.
Tadqiqot muhokamasi: Malakali voleybol jamoalarining o‘yin faoliyatining o‘ziga xos
xususiyatlarini batafsilroq tushunish uchun muntazam chempionatda ham, finalda ham g'alaba
qozongan va mag'lub bo‘lgan o‘yinda qo‘lga kiritilgan ochkolar sonini o‘rganishga qaratilgan
tadqiqotlar o‘tkazildi. 1-jadvaldagi ma'lumotlar tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki, jamoalar
musobaqaning birinchi bosqichida g'alaba qozongan o‘yinda eng kam ochko to‘plashgan - 75,1
± 4,3 ball va mag'lubiyat - 71,2 ± 7,8 ball, va ko‘rib chiqilayotgan ko‘rsatkichlar sezilarli
farqlarga ega emas (p >0,05). 1-jadval

ko‘rsatkichi mag'lubiyatga uchragan o‘yinlar ko‘rsatkichlaridan sezilarli darajada oshib ketdi
(p<0,05; 1-jadval).
Jadval ma’lumotlarini sarhisob qilar ekanmiz, shuni aytish kerakki, pley-off va final
o‘yinlarida malakali voleybolchilar tayyorgarlikning barcha jihatlari, jumladan, texnik, taktik
va psixologik jihatlarni safarbar qilish hisobiga g‘alabali o‘yinda ko‘proq ochko olishadi.
1-rasmdagi ma’lumotlar tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki, Oliy liganing O’zFinPI va Road Patrul
voleybol jamoalari o‘yin mavsumida ko‘pincha 0:3 – 21,7% hisobida mag‘lub bo‘lishgan.

o‘yinlarning 18,8 foizida 3:0 hisobida g'alaba qozongan va 1:3 hisobida mag'lub bo‘lgan (1rasm). Qayd etish joizki, saralangan jamoalar barcha o‘yinlarning 14,4 foizida 2:3 hisobida
mag‘lub bo‘lishadi, shuningdek, 3:1 va 3:2 hisobida zafar quchmoqda – mos ravishda 12,5 va
13,8 foiz.
Olingan natijalar o‘yin mavsumida Oliy liganing O’zFinPI va Road Patrul voleybol
jamoalarida o‘yinda ijobiy natijaga erishishni ta'minlovchi barqaror tendentsiya yo‘qligini
aytishga imkon beradi. Shu munosabat bilan, taxmin qilish mumkinki, rasmiy o‘yinlardagi
sezilarli xilma-xil natijalar, bir tomondan, ma'lum bir ligada o‘ynaydigan yetarlicha kuchli
raqiblar bilan bog'liq bo‘lsa, boshqa tomondan, jamoaning o‘yin faoliyatini boshqarish emas
har doim zamonaviy pedagogik va psixologik texnologiyalardan foydalanish variantida
ta'minlanadi.
Xulosa. Pedagogik kuzatishlar natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, voleybol jamoalari
o‘tkazilgan barcha o‘yinlarning 18,8 foizida 3:0 hisobida g'alaba qozongan va 1:3 hisobida

Mavzuning dolzarbligi: Harakat faoliyati maxsus anjomlar (voleybol', futbol, basketbol,
gandbol toʻplari, shayba, volan va h.) bilan ijro etiladigan vaziyatli sport turlarida yuksak
musobaqa natijasiga erishish ustuvor jihatdan tezkorlik va aniqlik omillariga bogʻliqdir.
Ma'lumki, bunday sport turlarida musobaqa muddati rasmiy qoidalar asosida vaqt (futbol,
basketbol, gandbol va h.) yoki hisob-ochko (voleybol, tennis va h.) bilan belgilanadi. Binobarin,
uzoq muddat davom etadigan musobaqalarda yuksak tezkorlik va aniqlikni saqlash imkoniyati
maxsus chidamkorlik sifatiga asoslanadi. Sport oʻyinlarida harakat tezkorligining keskin
oʻzgaruvchan vaziyatlarda kechishi aniqlik darajasini chegaralab qoʻyadi.
Jismoniy tarbiya va sport trenerovkasi nazariyasi va uslubiyati fanlari doirasida faoliyat
koʻrsatib kelayotgan koʻplab mutaxasis- olimlarning fikr - muloxazalari va xulosalariga koʻra,
koʻp yillik sport trenerovkasining barcha bosqichlarida jismoniy sifatlarni rivojlantirish
strategiyasi doimo tanlangan sport turining xususiyatlariga mos boʻlish muhim va shart ekanligi
ta'kidlanadi (V.P.Filin, 1995; Yu.D.Jeleznyak, 1998; L.P.Matveev, 1999; J.K.Xolodov,
V.S.Kuznesov, 2000; V.N.Platonov, 2004; Yu.M.Yunusova, 2005).[1]
Tadqiqot maqsadi. Yosh voleybolchilarning yonlama harakatlanish tezkorligini
rivojlantirish uchun maxsus texnik harakatlardan iborat mashqlar majmuasini ishlab chiqish.
Tadqiqotning ob'ekti. Yosh voleybolchilarning yonlama harakatlanish to‘pni aniq
uzatish texnik harakatlarini rivojlantirishga yoʻnaltirilgan oʻquv mashgʻulotlari jarayoni
Tadqiqotning natijalari va muhokamasi: Mazkur ilmiy maqolada yosh voleybolchilar
tayyorlash amaliyotida yonlanma xarakatlanish imkoniyatini shakllantirish tajribasi va ushbu
qobiliyatni takomillashtirish imkoniyatlarini oʻrganish tadqiqot ostiga olingan. Jumladan, ushbu
sport turida raqib maydoni tomonidan yoʻnaltiriladigan toʻplar (toʻp kiritish, zarba berish,
uzatish) yon chiziqlarga parallel yoki diagonal tartibda amalga oshiriladi. Demak, toʻp
yoʻnalishiga nisbatan harakatlanish, uni oʻz vaqtida qabul qilish va «manzilga» etkazish aniqligi
yonlama harakatlanish tezkorligiga bogʻlik boʻladi.
Umum ta'lim maktab qoshidagi voleybol toʻgaraklari va SMlarda oʻtkazilayotgan
mashgʻulotlarni kuzatish natijasida shu narsa ma'lum boʻldiki, oʻrgatish va takomillashtirish
jarayonining barcha bosqichlarida yonlama harakatlanish tezkorligi va toʻp uzatish aniqligini
qoʻshma usulda shakllantirish masalasiga jiddiy e'tibor qaratilmas ekan. Biz tadqiqot jarayonida
anashu muommoni echish maqsadida bir nechta yonlanma harakat mashqlarini ishlab chiqib
sportchilarda qo‘lladik. Tadqiqot boshi va oxirida testlardan foydalangan holda natijani qayta
o‘rgandik (1-jadval)

1-rasm. Yosh voleybolchi 9-3-6-3-9 м.ga mokisimon yugurish tezligining tajriba
davomidagi dinamikasi. Tajriba guruhida esa mazkur koʻrsatkichlar quyidagicha ifodalandi:
- tajribadan avval - 35,2 sek;
- tajribadan keyin - 30,4 sek;
- tezkorlikning oʻsish farqi - 5,2 sek (1-rasm).
«Archasimon» yoʻnalishda mokisimon yugurish testi boʻyicha voleybolchi talaba
qizlarda tezkorlik me'yorining eng kam koʻrsatgichi 26,0 sek. deb belgilangan.
Albatta, 14-15 yoshli voleybolchi bolalarda olingan mazkur koʻrsatgichlarni voleybolchi
talabalar koʻrsatgichlari bilan qiyoslash notoʻgʻri boʻladi. Har holda yosh voleybolchi bolalarda
olingan koʻrsatgichlarni shu yoshdagi voleybolchi bolalar uchun etarli emas deb ehtimol qilish
mumkin. Muhimi shundaki, nazorat guruhida ham, tajriba guruhida ham tajribadan avval
olingan koʻrsatgichlar tajriba davomida qoʻllanilgan an'anaviy va eksperimental mazmunli
mashgʻulotlardan soʻng turlicha yoʻnalishda ifodalandi.
Boshqacha qilib aytganda, tajriba guruhida tajriba davomida qoʻllanilgan oʻyinsimon
tezkorlik mashqlari maydon boʻylab harakatlanish tezkorligini samarali oʻstirish salohiyatiga
ega ekanligi aniqlandi. Demak, magistrlik tadqiqot yuzasidan oʻtkazilgan pedagogik tajribada
oʻz samaradorligini namoyish etgan oʻyinsimon mashqlarni yosh voleybolchilarni tayyorlashda
maydon boʻylab harakatlanish tezkorligini oshirish uchun muntazam qoʻllash foydali natijaga
erishish imkoniyati yaratadi deb xulosa qilish mumkin.

quyidagi nisbiy oʻsish darajalariga erishildi:
1 – yosh voleybolchilarni 9-3-6-3-9 м.ga mokisimon yugurish tezligining tajriba oxiriga
kelib - tajribadan avval - 35,2 sek; - tajribadan keyin - 30,4 sek;- tezkorlikning oʻsish farqi - 5,2
sek olingan koʻrsatkichlarining orasida oʻrtacha nisbiy farqi tajriba guruhida11,18 % ga
yaxshilanganligi aniqlandi;
2 - yosh voleybolchilarni «Archasimon» yoʻnalishda mokisimon yugurish testi boʻyicha
voleybolchi talaba qizlarda tezkorlik me'yorining eng kam koʻrsatgichi 26,0 sek. deb
belgilangan. oʻrtacha nisbiy farqi nazorat guruh voleybolchilarida tajriba guruhida 17,38%ga
yaxshilanganligi aniqlandi;
3 - Yonlama 4X10 mokisimon yugurish (sek) testi natijalari bo‘yicha yosh
voleybolchilarning natijalari tajribadan oldin 14,72±1,5 sekundni tashkil qilgan bo‘lsa
tajribadan soְ‘ng bu ko‘rsatgich ham bir muncha yaxshilanganligini ko‘rishimiz mumkin
12,26±0,9 sekundni tashkil qilgan bu 11,35 % ga yaxshilanishiga erishildi;
Yosh voleybolchilarni yonlama mokisimon yugurish tezkorlik ko‘rsatgichlari
kombinasion harakatlari voleybolda hujum qilish jarayonida asosiy rol oʻy naydi va ushbu
harakatlarni takomillashtirish orqali musobaqalarda yuqori natijalarga erishish mumkin.

Annotatsiya:Mazkur ilmiy maqolada 10–13 yoshli voleybolchilarni to‘pni qabul qilish
va uzatish texnikasini shakllantirishga qaratilgan innovatsion-uslubiy yondashuvning
samaradorligi o‘rganildi. Tadqiqotda ikki guruh (nazorat va tajriba) o‘rtasida 6 hafta davomida
maxsus mashg‘ulotlar tashkil etildi. Tajriba guruhida reflektor mashqlar, vizual ko‘maklar,
o‘yinli topshiriqlar va individuallashtirilgan mashg‘ulotlar asosida treninglar olib borildi.
Nazorat guruhida esa an’anaviy usullar qo‘llandi.Tajriba yakunida tajriba guruhi sportchilarida
to‘pni qabul qilish aniqligi 28.3%, uzatma aniqligi 30% ga oshdi. 2-usul asosida o‘tkazilgan
baholashda uzatma aniqligi 85% ni tashkil etdi. Harakatlar koordinatsiyasi bo‘yicha esa
reaksiya vaqti 0.15 soniyaga qisqardi. Student t-kriteriyasi asosida o‘tkazilgan statistik tahlilda
p < 0.01 darajasida muhim farqlar aniqlandi, bu esa metodikaning yuqori ilmiy-amaliy
samaradorligini tasdiqladi.
Tadqiqot natijalari asosida sport to‘garaklari va boshlang‘ich tayyorlov bosqichidagi
murabbiylar uchun amaliy tavsiyalar ishlab chiqildi. Uslubiyat voleybolchilarning texnik
ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishga xizmat qiladi hamda jamoaviy o‘yin sifati va samaradorligini
oshirish imkonini beradi.

METHOD OF FORMING YOUNG VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS' BALL
RECEIVING AND PASSING TECHNIQUES
Abstract:This scientific article explores the effectiveness of an innovative
methodological approach to developing ball reception and passing techniques in young
volleyball players aged 10–13. As part of the study, special training sessions were conducted
over six weeks involving two groups (control and experimental). In the experimental group,
training incorporated reflex-based exercises, visual aids, game-based tasks, and individualized
methods, while the control group followed traditional approaches.
By the end of the experiment, ball reception accuracy in the experimental group improved
by 28.3%, and passing accuracy and speed increased by 30%. According to the second
evaluation method, passing accuracy reached 85%. Coordination skills also improved, with
reaction time decreasing by 0.15 seconds. Statistical analysis using Student’s t-test revealed
significant differences at the p < 0.01 level, confirming the high scientific and practical
effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
Based on the research results, practical recommendations were developed for coaches
working at the initial stage of volleyball training. The proposed method enhances the technical
skills of young athletes and contributes to improving the quality and effectiveness of team play.

Kirish. Bugungi kunda sportni, xususan, voleybolni ommalashtirish va yuqori malakali
sportchilar zaxirasini yaratish jarayonida yosh sportchilarning texnik tayyorgarligiga alohida
e’tibor qaratilmoqda. Ayniqsa, voleybol o‘yinining asosiy tarkibiy qismlaridan biri bo‘lgan
to‘pni qabul qilish va uni aniq uzatish texnikasi jamoaviy o‘yin madaniyatining boshlang‘ich
bosqichi sifatida muhim o‘rin tutadi. Ushbu texnik harakatlarni erta yoshdan boshlab to‘g‘ri va
bosqichma-bosqich o‘rgatish sportchining kelgusi faoliyati uchun mustahkam poydevor bo‘lib
xizmat qiladi.
Zamonaviy sport pedagogikasi tajribasi shuni ko‘rsatmoqdaki, 8–12 yoshli sportchilarda
texnika shakllanishining dastlabki bosqichi yuqori darajadagi koordinatsion va psixomotorik
qobiliyatlarning rivojlanishi bilan bevosita bog‘liq. To‘pni qabul qilishdagi xatolar, ayniqsa
to‘pni qabul qilishda, o‘yin ritmining buzilishiga, jamoaviy muvofiqlikning pasayishiga va
hujum samaradorligining kamayishiga olib keladi. Shu sababli, mazkur texnik jihatlarni
metodik asoslangan, zamonaviy vositalar va o‘quv mashqlar majmuasi orqali shakllantirish
dolzarb masalalardan biri hisoblanadi.
O‘zbekistonda sport maktablari va to‘garaklar soni ortib borayotgan bir paytda, malakali
murabbiylar tomonidan yosh avlodga to‘g‘ri texnik bilimlarni singdirish, ayniqsa to‘p bilan
ishlash madaniyatini shakllantirish zarurati kuchaymoqda. Xalqaro tajriba esa bu boradagi
mashg‘ulotlar intensivligi, individual yondashuv va didaktik o‘yinli usullarning samaradorligini
ko‘rsatmoqda.
Shuningdek, bugungi kunda ushbu yo‘nalishda ilmiy-tadqiqot ishlarining soni ham ortib
borayotgani, sport texnologiyalari va trening metodikalarining yangilanishi yosh sportchilar
tayyorgarligini ilmiy asosda takomillashtirish imkonini bermoqda.
Shu jihatdan, yosh voleybolchilarda to‘pni qabul qilish va uzatish texnikasini
shakllantirishga qaratilgan uslubiy tadqiqotlar amaliyot uchun muhim ahamiyatga ega bo‘lib,

To‘pni harakatda (sakrash, o‘ng/chapga siljish) qabul qilish texnikasi.
Uzatma yo‘nalishini o‘zgartirish: har xil burchaklar ostida uzatma texnikasi.
Ko‘p martalik takroriy uzatmalar — har xil tezlik va yo‘nalishlarda.
Integratsion bosqich (5–6-hafta):Maqsad: texnik ko‘nikmalarni o‘yinga tatbiq qilish.
“To‘pni qabul qilish, uzatma, hujum” zanjirli harakatlar.
Raqib xatti-harakatiga qarab texnik yo‘nalishni o‘zgartirish (shartli signal asosida).
Raqobatli o‘yinlar: “Kim aniqroq?”, “Pas aniq bo‘lsa — ochko!”, “Chap-qo‘l uzatma
raqobati”.
Innovatsiyalar: Vizual ko‘mak (videoanaliz, texnika namunalarini ko‘rsatish)
Multisensorli stimullar (signal, rasm, raqamli topshiriqlar)
Mashqlarni murakkablashtirish: vaqt bosimi, harakatli fon, shovqin fonida bajarish
Nazorat guruhi (NG) – An’anaviy o‘quv-metodik mashg‘ulotlar.
Nazorat guruhida treninglar ham haftasiga 3 marta, 60 daqiqadan o‘tkazildi.
Mashg‘ulotlar odatiy uslub asosida olib borildi, ya’ni takroriy texnik mashqlar va jamoaviy
o‘yin bilan cheklangan.
Asosiy mashg‘ulot turlari: Joyidan va harakatda ikkala qo‘l bilan yuqori pas uzatmalar
(3–5 daqiqa), joyidan pastdan ikki qo‘l bilan qabul qilish (5–7 daqiqa).
2x2 o‘yin shakllari, asosan, qabul qilishga va umumiy holatga e’tibor, to‘pni qabul
qilishda murabbiy tomonidan statik zarbani qabul qilish (murakkablik darajasi orttirilmagan),
o‘yin oxirida erkin voleybol o‘ynash (o‘rganilgan harakatlar baholashsiz tatbiq qilingan).
Eksperiment boshlanishida o‘tkazilgan texnik baholash shuni ko‘rsatdiki, har ikki
guruhda o‘yinchilarning to‘pni qabul qilishdagi aniqligi o‘rtacha 48–52% atrofida bo‘lgan.
Pastdan uzatish texnikasida esa tezlik va aniqlik darajasi past, harakatlar noaniq va beqaror
ko‘rinishda edi.

Izoh: O‘sish mavjud bo‘lsa-da, bu nisbatan sust o‘zgarish bo‘lib, murakkab texnikani
faqat an’anaviy mashg‘ulot bilan mukammal shakllantirib bo‘lmasligini ko‘rsatadi.
Uzatma aniqligi va tezligi: Ball asosida baholash: 2.5 balldan 3.1 ballga ko‘tarilib, foiz
ko‘rinishida 50% dan 62% ga o‘sgan. Bu esa o‘rtacha texnik ko‘rsatkich bo‘lib, hali yuqori
darajadagi uzatma texnikasiga yetmaganligini bildiradi. 2-usul bo‘yicha hisoblash (foiz):
Sportchi tomonidan 20 ta uzatmadan 12 tasi aniq bajarilgan bo‘lib, bu 60.0% aniqlikni
ko‘rsatadi. Bu metod uzatma texnikasini real o‘yinga yaqin formatda baholash imkonini beradi,
ya’ni aniqlikni sof urinishlar soniga nisbatan ko‘rsatadi.
Harakatlar koordinatsiyasi (reaksiya vaqti): Boshlanishda: 0.77 soniya, Yakunida: 0.72
soniyaga qisqardi. Farq kichik (–0.05 sek.) bo‘lsa-da, bu harakatlar koordinatsiyasi
yaxshilanganini bildiradi.
Nazorat guruhi an’anaviy metodlar asosida shug‘ullangan, bu esa texnik o‘zgarishlarning
umuman borligini, ammo yetarli darajada tez va chuqur shakllanmaganligini ko‘rsatadi. 2-usul
— ya’ni uzatma aniqligini real urinishlar orqali aniqlash yanada aniq, shaffof va baholashda
ishonchliroq bo‘ladi. Bunday tahlil tajriba guruhi bilan solishtirilganda metodik yondashuvlar
orasidagi farqni yanada yaqqol ochib beradi.

yakunida: 78.6% aniqlikka erishilgan. Bu juda katta o‘sish bo‘lib, qabul qilish texnikasining
sezilarli darajada yaxshilanganini ko‘rsatadi. Yangi metodika orqali reflektor mashqlar, o‘yinli
yondashuv va servisni dinamik qabul qilish amaliyotlari samarali bo‘lgan.
Uzatma aniqligi va tezligi (foiz va 2-usul bilan): Foiz hisobida: 52% dan 82% gacha

Yakunida: 0.63 soniyaga qisqargan. –0.15 soniyalik farq yosh sportchilarda reaksiya
tezligining oshganini ko‘rsatadi. Bu sportchining voqea-hodisalarga tez javob qaytarishga
o‘rganganini, harakatini optimallashtirganini bildiradi.
Tajriba guruhi mashg‘ulotlari bosqichma-bosqich va o‘yinli metodika asosida olib
borilgani tufayli, har uchala ko‘rsatkichda ham yaqqol ijobiy natija kuzatildi. Ayniqsa, uzatma
texnikasida 2-usul bo‘yicha 85% aniqlikka erishilgani - bu metodik yondashuvning yuqori
samaradorligini ko‘rsatmoqda. Harakatlar koordinatsiyasidagi sezilarli yaxshilanish (reaksiya
vaqti kamayishi) yosh sportchilarni faol o‘yin rejimiga tayyorlashda muhim omil bo‘lib xizmat
qiladi.
Tajriba davomida 10–13 yoshdagi voleybolchilardan iborat tajriba guruhi (TG) va
**nazorat guruhi (NG)**da mashg‘ulotlar olib borildi. Har ikkala guruh uchun
mashg‘ulotlardan oldin va keyin texnik ko‘rsatkichlar (to‘pni qabul qilish aniqligi, uzatma
aniqligi va koordinatsion reaksiya vaqti) qayd etildi. Natijalarning haqiqiy farqliligini aniqlash
uchun Student t-kriteriyasi qo‘llanildi.
Statistik tahlil bosqichlari. 1. Muammo bayoni (Nol gipoteza H₀ va alternativ gipoteza
H₁): H₀ (nol gipoteza): Tajriba va nazorat guruhidagi o‘zgarishlar orasida statistik jihatdan
ahamiyatli farq yo‘q. H₁ (alternativ gipoteza): Tajriba guruhi foydasiga statistik jihatdan
ahamiyatli farq mavjud.
Metod: Student t-test. T-test — ikki mustaqil guruh orasidagi o‘rtacha qiymatlar farqini
baholashda ishlatiladi. Quyidagi formula qo‘llaniladi:
t=xˉ1−xˉ2s12n1+s22n2t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} +
\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}t=n1 s12+n2 s22xˉ1−xˉ2

Bu natija nol gipotezani rad etishga va alternativ gipotezani qabul qilishga imkon beradi.
Demak, taklif etilgan uslubiyat asosidagi mashg‘ulotlar natijasi tasodif emas, balki ilmiy
asoslangan yondashuvning samarasi hisoblanadi.
“Olingan natijalar Student t-kriteriyasi orqali tahlil qilinib, p < 0.01 darajasida statistik
ahamiyatga ega farqlar qayd etildi. Bu taklif etilgan metodikaning yuqori samaradorligini 99%
ishonchlilik bilan ilmiy jihatdan tasdiqlaydi.”
O‘tkazilgan eksperiment natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, yosh voleybolchilarda to‘pni qabul
qilish va uzatish texnikasini shakllantirishda qo‘llanilgan innovatsion-didaktik yondashuv
yuqori samaradorlikka ega. Xususan, tajriba guruhida texnik ko‘rsatkichlar bo‘yicha sezilarli
ijobiy o‘zgarishlar kuzatildi: to‘pni qabul qilish aniqligi 28.3%, uzatma aniqligi va tezligi esa
30% ga oshdi, harakatlar koordinatsiyasi (reaksiya vaqti) esa 0.15 sekundga yaxshilandi.
Taqqoslash uchun, nazorat guruhida bu o‘zgarishlar ancha sust bo‘lib, uzatma aniqligi
faqat 12%, to‘p qabul qilish esa atigi 8.2% ga yaxshilandi. Ayniqsa, uzatma aniqligi bo‘yicha
qo‘llangan 2-usul (aniq uzatma / umumiy urinish) asosida tajriba guruhida 85.0% aniqlik
ko‘rsatilgani - yangi metodikaning real samaradorligini tasdiqlaydi. Muhim jihat shundaki,
olingan natijalar Student t-kriteriyasi asosida statistik jihatdan tahlil qilindi. Hisob-kitoblarga
ko‘ra, tajriba guruhi natijalarida p < 0.01 darajasida ishonchlilik qayd etildi. Bu esa 99% ehtimol
bilan farqlar tasodifiy emas, balki aynan taklif etilgan metodika sababli yuzaga kelganini
isbotlaydi.
Shuningdek, mashg‘ulotlar mazmunida qo‘llangan. O‘yinli yondashuvlar (vizual
reaktsiya, shartli topshiriqlar). Differensial yondashuv (sportchining xatolari asosida
moslashtirilgan mashqlar); individuallashtirish va takroriy texnik avtomatizatsiya; barchasi
sportchilarda texnik ko‘nikmalarning chuqur shakllanishiga xizmat qilgan. Bu jarayonda
harakatlar avval oddiy, keyin murakkab holatlarga o‘tkazilishi orqali reflektor ko‘nikmalar
mustahkamlangan. Ushbu natijalar ilgari chop etilgan ilmiy ishlarga uyg‘un holda namoyon
bo‘ldi. Jumladan:L. R. Ayrapetyans (2009) va G. A. Barchuk (2018) o‘z tadqiqotlarida texnik
harakatlarni shakllantirishda tizimlilik va bosqichlilik zarurligini asoslagan. R. Papageorgiou,
Boltaev Z.B va D. Zimmermann (2021) esa voleybolchilar tayyorgarligida murakkab
texnikalarni o‘rgatishda ko‘p marotabalik va individual topshiriqlarning ahamiyatini
ta’kidlagan. Demak, taklif etilgan mashg‘ulot metodikasi nafaqat eksperimental guruhda yuqori
natijalar berdi, balki bu natijalar statistik jihatdan ham ishonchli bo‘lib, ilg‘or ilmiy
konsepsiyalar bilan hamohangdir. Unga asoslangan yondashuvlar O‘zbekiston sharoitida yosh
voleybolchilar tayyorgarligini samarali tashkil etish uchun amaliy tavsiya sifatida joriy etilishi
mumkin.
O‘tkazilgan ilmiy-tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, yosh voleybolchilarni to‘pni qabul
qilish va uzatish texnikasini shakllantirishda innovatsion, o‘yinli va bosqichli yondashuv
asosidagi mashg‘ulotlar samarali natija beradi. Taklif etilgan metodik tizimning asosiy
ustunliklari — harakatlarni avtomatlashtirishga xizmat qiluvchi reflektor mashqlar, vizual

ko‘maklar, differensial topshiriqlar va individual yondashuvlar orqali texnik ko‘nikmalarni
chuqur singdirishdan iborat bo‘ldi.
Tajriba guruhida 6 haftalik mashg‘ulotlar yakunida to‘pni qabul qilish aniqligi 28.3% ga,
uzatma aniqligi va tezligi esa 30% ga oshdi. Ayniqsa, 2-usul bo‘yicha uzatma aniqligi 85.0% ni
tashkil qilgani metodikaning amaliy samaradorligini isbotlaydi. Harakatlar koordinatsiyasi
ko‘rsatkichi esa 0.15 sekundga yaxshilanib, sportchilarning reaksiya tezligi oshgani aniqlandi.
Nazorat guruhida o‘zgarishlar sezilarli darajada past bo‘lib, bu an’anaviy mashg‘ulotlar
samaradorligining cheklanganligini ko‘rsatdi. Student t-kriteriyasi yordamida o‘tkazilgan
statistik tahlillar esa p < 0.01 darajasida ishonchlilikni ko‘rsatib, farqlar tasodifiy emas, balki
metodikaning haqiqiy ta’siri natijasida yuzaga kelganini ilmiy asosda tasdiqladi.
Ushbu tadqiqot L.R. Ayrapetyans, G.A. Barchuk, R. Papageorgiou, Boltaev Z.B va D.
Zimmermann singari olimlarning nazariy qarashlari bilan mos keladi. Ular yosh sportchilarni
tayyorlashda individual yondashuv, tizimlilik, ko‘p marotabalik va metodik izchillikni
ta’kidlagan.
Shu bois, ushbu ilmiy maqolada ishlab chiqilgan uslubiyat O‘zbekiston sharoitida sport
maktablari va to‘garaklarida faoliyat yuritayotgan murabbiylar uchun amaliy tavsiya sifatida
qo‘llanilishi mumkin. Metodik yondashuv voleybolchilarning texnik tayyorgarligini
rivojlantirish, jamoaviy o‘yin sifati va natijadorligini oshirishga xizmat qiladi.
O‘tkazilgan ilmiy-tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatdiki, yosh voleybolchilarni to‘pni qabul
qilish va uzatish texnikasini shakllantirishda innovatsion, o‘yinli va bosqichli yondashuv
asosidagi mashg‘ulotlar samarali natija beradi. Taklif etilgan metodik tizimning asosiy
ustunliklari - harakatlarni avtomatlashtirishga xizmat qiluvchi reflektor mashqlar, vizual
ko‘maklar, differensial topshiriqlar va individual yondashuvlar orqali texnik ko‘nikmalarni
chuqur singdirishdan iborat bo‘ldi.
Tajriba guruhida 6 haftalik mashg‘ulotlar yakunida to‘pni qabul qilish aniqligi 28.3% ga,
uzatma aniqligi va tezligi esa 30% ga oshdi. Ayniqsa, 2-usul bo‘yicha uzatma aniqligi 85.0% ni
tashkil qilgani metodikaning amaliy samaradorligini isbotlaydi. Harakatlar koordinatsiyasi
ko‘rsatkichi esa 0.15 sekundga yaxshilanib, sportchilarning reaksiya tezligi oshgani aniqlandi.
Nazorat guruhida o‘zgarishlar sezilarli darajada past bo‘lib, bu an’anaviy mashg‘ulotlar
samaradorligining cheklanganligini ko‘rsatdi. Student t-kriteriyasi yordamida o‘tkazilgan
statistik tahlillar esa p < 0.01 darajasida ishonchlilikni ko‘rsatib, farqlar tasodifiy emas, balki
metodikaning haqiqiy ta’siri natijasida yuzaga kelganini ilmiy asosda tasdiqladi.
Ushbu tadqiqot L.R. Ayrapetyans, G.A. Barchuk, R. Papageorgiou, Boltaev Z.B va D.
Zimmermann singari olimlarning nazariy qarashlari bilan mos keladi. Ular yosh sportchilarni
tayyorlashda individual yondashuv, tizimlilik, ko‘p marotabalik va metodik izchillikni
ta’kidlagan.
Shu bois, ushbu ilmiy maqolada ishlab chiqilgan uslubiyat O‘zbekiston sharoitida sport

an’analar va zamonaviy yondashuvlar asosida tobora takomillashib bormoqda. Sport
tayyorgarligi birinchi tomondan o‘zining ijtimoiy-siyosiy asoslariga ko‘ra g‘alabaga erishish,
yuqori natijalar qayd etish va inson imkoniyatlarini namoyish qilish xususiyatlari bilan
xarakterlanadi[1, 2]. Shu bilan birga sport inson ma’naviy, axloqiy va ruhiy barkamolligi
vositasi sifatida hamda o‘zining ijtimoiy ahamiyati bilan ham jamiyatda nihoyatda muhim
vazifalarni bajaradi. Yuqoridagi manbaalarda bildirilgan fikr-mulohazalardan ko‘rinadiki, sport
bir vaqtning o‘zida ham qoidalar asosida amalga oshadigan o‘zaro raqobat faoliyati hisoblansa,
boshqa jihatdan yuksak ma’naviy, axloqiy va estetik ahamiyatga ega muhim vosita sanaladi.
Asosiy qism. Bir qator mutaxassislarning fikricha zamonaviy sport bir paytning o‘zida
jamiyatda qator muhim vazifalarni bajarishi bilan ahamiyatlidir. Xususan sport orqali yoshlar
tarbiyasi, ta’lim muassasalarida sport, aholining turli qatlamlari orasida sog‘lomlashtirish
vositalari sifatida tobora dolzarblashib bormoqda. Yuqoridagilarga asosan ta’kidlash kerakki,
zamonaviy sport jamiyatda o‘zining ko‘pfunktsiyaliligi va xilma-xilligi, inson va jamiyatga
beradigan ijobiy ta’siri bilan ahamiyatlidir.
Muayyan sport turida yuqori natijalarga erishish, tayyorgarlik tizimini samarali
boshqarish, sport tayyorgarligi jarayonida individual yondashish kabi vazifalarning samarali
yo‘lga qo‘yilishi bilan bog‘liq ekanligi bir qator ilmiy adabiyotlarda ta’kidlab o‘tilgan [3].
Shunga qaramasdan yuqori darajadagi sport natijalarining keskin o‘sib borishi, xalqaro sport
musobaqalarida natijalar qayd etishning tobora murakkablashib borayotganligi hamda boshqa
shu kabi bir qator omillar sababli sport tayyorgarligi tizimining ilmiy asoslarini yanada
rivojlantirish zarurati yuzaga keladi [4].
Sportchilar tayyorlash tizimi borasidagi so‘nggi ilmiy adabiyotlar ko‘lami tobora ortib
bormoqda. Bu borada so‘z borganda tayyorgarlikning biologik asoslari asosan katta ahamiyat
kasb etayotganligini ta’kidlash kerak. Masalan, V.Issurin olib borgan tadqiqotlariga asosan
ta’kidlaydiki, uzoq yillik tayyorgarlik jarayonida sportchi organizmining biologik omillari o‘ta
muhim hisoblanadi. Tayyorgarlikning samarali yo‘lga qo‘yilishi, kelgusi sport natijalarini
maqsadga muvofiq rejalashtirish bevosita bilogik xususiyatlarga aloqador hisoblanadi.
Darhaqiqat, mazkur masalada fikr yuritiladigan bo‘lsa, organizm yaxlit tizim sifatida biologik
qonuniyatlar asosida faoliyat ko‘rsatadi.
Xalqaro ilmiy ma’lumotlar bazalari, ilmiy ma’lumotlarni qidiruv tizimlari va ilmiy
axborot manbaalaridan zamonaviy sport tayyorgarligiga doir manbaalarning tahlili mazkur
sohaga turli fan yo‘nalishlariga xos bo‘lgan bilimlar integratsiyasi ta’sir etayotganligini
tasdiqlaydi. Xususan, Qiu (va hammualliflar, 2013), fikricha zamonaviy sport musobaqalari va
tayyorgarlik jarayonining xarakterli jihati kompyuter texnologiyalarining sportga keng joriy
etilishi hisoblanadi [5]. Sportga tanlash, mashg‘ulotlar jarayonini maqsadga muvofiq tashkil
etish, musobaqalarni o‘tkazish, sportchi tayyorgarligini monitoring qilish kompyuter
texnologiyalari asosida yanada samarali yuzaga keladi.
Bu boradagi tahlillar dunyo miqyosidagi boshqa olimlar tomonidan ham yetarlicha
o‘rganilgan. Masalan, P.Jernej (2018), o‘z tahlillariga asosan sportda ko‘ptomonlama faktorlar
273

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

mavjudligini e’tirof etadi. Uning ta’kidlashicha, zamonaviy sport tayyorgarligi o‘zining yangi
fenomeni, yangicha qarashlari, xususan, tenglik, hamkorlik va boshqa ijobiy xarakterlari bilan
aks etmoqda. Shunga qaramasdan, hozirda ham ba’zi salbiy ta’sirlar mazkur sohani
rivojlantirishga yetarlicha ta’sir etmoqda. Bizning fikrimizcha mazkur holat, birinchidan,
sportni rivojlantirishning zamonaviy tendentsiyalari tobora takomillashib, rivojlanib
borayotganligini ifodalasa, ikkinchidan, zamonaviy sport taraqqiyoti oldida muayyan vazifalar
va muammolar mavjudligini ko‘rsatadi.
Sport amaliyotidan ma’lumki, dunyo miqyosida turli mamlakatlarda sportchilar
tayyorlash tizimi o‘ziga xos ravishda tashkil etilgan. Bunda muayyan hududning ijtimoiy,
iqtisodiy va tabiiy rivojlanish va imkoniyatlaridan kelib chiqib yondashuvlar yo‘lga qo‘yilgan.
So‘nggi tadqiqotlarga tayaniladigan bo‘lsa, sport tayyorgarligini rivojlantirishda sotsiologik
jihatlar o‘ziga xos ta’sir etadi. Turli hududlar va mintaqalarning ijtimoiy xususiyatlariga ko‘ra
sport muayyan darajada rivojlanish darajalari qayd etiladi.
P.Gamble fikricha [5], hozirgi zamon sportida rejalashtirish va mashg‘ulotlar jarayonini
samarali tashkil etish sport turining o‘ziga xos xususiyatlariga bog‘liq. Xususan, jamoaviy sport
turlari boshqa toifadagi sport turlaridan ma’lum darajada farqlanadi. Bunda rejalashtirishga
alohida ahamiyat qaratilib, yillik musobaqalar rejalashtirish jarayonida hisobga olinishi kerak.
Аlbatta, mazkur fikrlar ma’lum ma’noda ilmiy asoslarga ega bo‘lib, zamonaviy sportchilar
tayyorlash tizimida qo‘llanilib kelinmoqda. Shu bilan birga, boshqa yondashuvlar mavjudki,
bunda sport turi asosida tayyorgarlikni amalga oshirish ikkilamchi ahamiyatga ega hisoblanadi.
Masalan, N.Estélio (va hammualliflar, 2022) fikricha, hozirda sportchilar tayyorlashda turli
davrlashtirish uslublari qo‘llanilmoqda. Xususan, davrlashtirishning Matveev modeli,
Verxoshanskiy modeli, Valdivelso modeli, Vorobev modeli, Platonov modeli, Bompa modeli
va boshqa shu kabilar amaliyotda keng qo‘llaniladi. Mazkur rejalashtirish dasturlari o‘ziga xos
xususiy jihatlar bilan farqlansa-da, ular umumiy qonuniyatlar va xarakterli jihatlar bilan
aloqador hisoblanadi.
V.Platonov o‘zining so‘nggi tadqiqotlari doirasida Norvegiya va Kanada terma
jamoalarining Olimpiya o‘yinlariga tayyorgarlik tizimini tahlil etgan. Ma’lumki, mazkur
mamlakatlar terma jamoalari xalqaro sport musobaqalarida o‘ziga xos o‘ringa ega va barqaror
natijalar qayd etib kelmoqda. Mazkur tahlil natijalari shuni tasdiqlaydiki, Olimpiya o‘yinlari va
boshqa shu kabi xalqaro musobaqalarda yuqori natijalarni qayd etish sport tayyorgarligini ilmiy
asosda tashkil etish, sport siyosati, ommaviy sport va oliy sport mahorati kabi bosqichlar
mazkur mamlakatlarda sport tayyorgarligining asosiy faktorlari hisoblanadi.
Аdabiyotlar sharhi va tahlil natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, paralimpiya sportida
tayyorgarlik jarayoni o‘ziga xos ahamiyatga ega. Ma’lumki, paralimpiya sporti dunyo bo‘ylab
nogironligi bo‘lgan kishilarni sog‘lom hayotga qaytarish, ular orasida jismoniy faollikni targ‘ib
qilishga yo‘naltirilgan tizim hisoblanadi. Mazkur mavzu bo‘yicha olib borilgan tadqiqotlar va
adabiyotlar shuni ko‘rsatadiki, paralimpiya sportida odatdagi tayyorgarlik tizimidan ko‘ra
274

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

xususiy yondashuv muhim ahamiyatga ega. Olib borilgan tahlillardan ko‘rinadiki, zamonaviy
sportda paralimpiya sportchilarini tayyorlash o‘ziga xosligi va xususiy jihatlari bilan farqlanadi.
V.Issurinning fikricha sportchilar tayyorgarligi tizimini takomillashtirish bir qator sabab
va zaruratlar asosida yuzaga keladi. Quyidagi asosiy omillar olim tomonidan qayd etilgan:
1) sport musobaqalari sonining ortib borishi mashg‘ulotlar vaqtining keskin qisqarib
boriga olib kelmoqda;
2) sportchi tayyorgarligi tizimining an’anaviy uslublaridagi mavjud kamchiliklar;
3) sport tayyorgarligi tizimining muqobil kontseptsiyalarining yuzaga kelayotganligi.
Yuqorida ko‘rsatilgan sabablar sport tayyorgarligi tizimida o‘ziga xos bo‘lgan, muqobil
uslubiyatlardan foydalanish va ularni amaliyotga samarali tatbiq etish zarurati yanada
dolzarblashadi. Bizning fikrimizcha, sport tayyorgarligi tizimida turlicha yondashuvlar va
uslubiyotlar joriy etilmoqda. O‘z navbatida mazkur yondashuvlar o‘zining yutuq va
kamchiliklari bilan xarakterlanadi.
Yu.Verxoshanskiyning fikricha uzoq yillik sport tayyorgarligi bir qancha qisqa davrlarni
o‘z ichiga olishi kerak. Mazkur kichik bosqichlar davomida xususiy vazifalar amalga oshiriladi.
Masalan, ba’zi kichik davrlarda jismoniy tayyorgarlikka alohida ahamiyat qaratilsa, keyinchalik
tayyorgarlikning boshqa jihatlari kompleks rivojlantirib boriladi. Bunda musobaqa
xususiyatlari, iqlim va sportchining imkoniyatlari hisobga olinishi kerak, albatta. Аmmo, ba’zi
mutaxassislar fikricha mazkur davrlashtirishda ham ma’lum ma’noda kamchiliklar mavjud.
Аdabiyotlar qiyosiy tahlilidan ma’lum bo‘ladiki, sportchilar tayyorlashning uzoq yillik
dasturlarini baholash va ularni amaliyotda qo‘llash bo‘yicha o‘zaro xilma-xil va qarama-qarshi
fikrlar mavjud.
So‘nggi tadqiqotlar va tajriba natijalari shuni tasdiqlaydiki, sportda saralash yuqori
natijalarni qayd etishni kafolatlovchi muhim omili hisoblanadi. Masalan, M.Starosta fikriga
ko‘ra zamonaviy sport tayyorgarligini boshqarishda 11ta bosqichdan iborat bo‘lib, sportchining
yutuqqa bo‘lgan imkoniyatlarini oshirishning dastlabki bosqichidan oliy sport yutuqlari
bosqichigacha bo‘lgan davrni qamrab oladi. Mazkur ma’lumotlar shuni tasdiqlaydiki, sport
tayyorgarligi bir qancha tayyorgarlik turlaridan iborat bo‘lganidek, bir nechta bosqichlardan
tashkil topadi. Ushbu bosqichlar o‘zaro ketma-ket va bir-birini to‘ldiruvchi hisoblanadi.
Tarixan ma’lumki, sport tayyorgarligini nazorat qilish va baholash masalasi
mutaxassislar tomonidan doimiy ravishda tadqiqot ob’ekti sifatida o‘rganib kelingan.
Ta’kidlash kerakki, hozirda ham mazkur masala sport taraqqiyotining yangi jihatlari va
sportchilar tayyorlashning istiqbol rejalarini belgilashda muhim o‘ringa egaligi bir qator ilmiy
manbaalarda o‘z aksini topgan.
Аdabiyotlar tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki, sport tayyorgarligi tizimida ma’lum yutuqlar va
ilg‘or tajribalar mavjud bo‘lishi bilan birga, mazkur masalaga doir o‘z ilmiy yechimini
kutayotgan vazifalar ham mavjud. Ushbu vazifalarning samarali hal etilishi sport taraqqiyotida
yangi natijalar qayd etilishiga zamin yaratadi.

Xulosa. Ilmiy-uslubiy manbaalarning qiyosiy tahlili natijasida dunyo bo‘yicha
sportchilar tayyorlash borasida xilma-xil yondashuvlar mavjudligi aniqlandi. Shu bilan birga
xalqaro sport hamjamiyatida sportchilar tayyorlash borasida umumiy xarakterli ilmiy
muammolar mavjud. Yuqorida qayd etilgan fikrlarni umumlashtirgan holda ta’kidlash kerakki,
sport tayyorgarligi muammosi doimiy ravishda rivojlanish, yosh xususiyatlarini inobatga olish
va taraqqiy etishga ehtiyoj sezadi. Mazkur sohani muntazam ravishda rivojlantirish, uning
ilmiy-uslubiy asoslarini takomillashtirib borish zarur.

ayniqsa maktab yoshidagi bolalarda mavjud bo‘lgan gipokineziya bilan bog‘liq bo‘lib, jismoniy
rivojlanishning tezlashishi bilan kuchayadi.
Yugurish barcha yoshdagilar uchun jismoniy takomillashtirishning samarali va qulay
vositasi bo‘lib, salomatlik va barkamol rivojlanishga hissa qo‘shadi. Biroq, yosh
yuguruvchilarni sportga tayyorlash muammosi ko‘p yillar davomida murabbiylar va
tadqiqotchilar o‘rtasida bahs va kelishmovchiliklarni keltirib chiqardi. Asosiy qaramaqarshiliklar bolalik va o‘smirlik davrlarini qamrab olgan sport mashg‘ulotlarining boshlang‘ich,
asosiy bosqichlariga taalluqlidir va yuqori sport natijalariga erishish uchun aynan shu bosqichlar
birinchi darajali ahamiyatga ega.
Adabiyotlar tahlili. Ma’lumki, ko‘pchilik sport turlarida, ayniqsa uzoq muddatli tsiklik
tayanch-harakat faoliyati bilan bog‘liq bo‘lgan sport turlari bo‘yicha yuqori sport natijalariga
erishish, chidamlilikni yuqori darajada rivojlantirmasdan mumkin emas. O‘rta masofaga
yugurish bo‘yicha erkaklar va ayollarning sport mashg‘ulotlarida yillik mashg‘ulot tsiklida
ularning tezlikka chidamliligini rivojlantirishning turli usullari katta ahamiyatga ega. Ushbu
usullarning o‘ziga xos xususiyati sportchilarning mashg‘ulot jarayoniga ularning tezlikka
chidamliligini rivojlantirish uchun vositalar va usullardan foydalanishning turli xil variantlarini
kiritishdadir. Hozirgi kunda yosh murabbiylar o‘zini tezroq isbotlamoqchi bo‘lib,
shogirdlarining har tomonlama tayyorgarligini unutib, ularning sport mashg‘ulotlariga
majburlashmoqda. Mintaqaviy musobaqalarda ba'zi sportchilarning tayanch-harakat tizimi zaif,
texnik, funktsional va jismoniy tayyorgarligi pastligi ko‘pincha seziladi. O‘rta va uzoq
masofalarga yugurishda yuqori natijalarga erishish uchun sportchilarning past motivatsiyasi
ham qayd etilgan. Shu bois, bu holat tashvishga sabab bo‘lmoqda va o‘ylaymizki, bunga ko‘p
jihatdan o‘rta masofaga yuguruvchilarning tezlikka chidamliligini rivojlantirish va umuman,
sport mashg‘ulotlariga tayyorgarlik ko‘rish bo‘yicha zamonaviy mashg‘ulot uslublari, amaliy
va uslubiy tavsiyalar yo‘qligi sabab bo‘lmoqda. Sportchilarda tezlikka chidamlilikni
rivojlantirish muammosi rus adabiyotida juda keng yoritilgan; o‘rta masofaga yuguruvchilarni
tayyorlashning mohiyati va mazmunini aniqlash, ularning jismoniy sifatlarini, umumiy va
maxsus chidamliligini, energiya bilan ta'minlash mexanizmlarini va mushaklarning intensiv
faolligi sharoitida ishlashni aniqlash masalalari yaxshi o‘rganildi. Ammo shu bilan birga,
ularning tezligiga chidamliligini rivojlantirishda turli yo‘nalishdagi usullarni qo‘llash,
birlashtirish va almashtirish masalasi juda kam o‘rganilgan. O‘rganilgan adabiyotlarni tahlil
qilish shuni ko‘rsatdiki, yuguruvchilarda tezlik chidamliligini rivojlantirish masalasini
yorituvchi etarli miqdordagi adabiy manbalar mavjud, ammo 15-16 yoshda ushbu jismoniy
sifatni rivojlantirish uchun turli yo‘nalishlarning usullari etarli emas. [1,2].
Yengil atletika juda ko‘p turli xil fanlarni o‘z ichiga olgan murakkab sport turi bo‘lib, uni
sport malikasi deb hisoblashlari bejiz emas va hatto "Tezroq, balandroq, kuchliroq" iborasini
unga 2/3 bilan bog‘lash mumkin. Birinchi qadimgi Yunoniston Olimpiya o‘yinlarida engil
atletika asosiy sport dasturi edi. Va o‘sha vaqtdan hozirgi kungacha u eng mashhur va asosiy
sport turi bo‘lib qolmoqda.

800 metrga tekis yugurish yengil atletikadagi eng qiyin masofalardan biri bo‘lib,
sportchining tanasiga nihoyatda yuqori talablarni qo‘yadi. Bu masofada yuqori atletik
natijalarga erishish uchun mukammal yugurish texnikasi, tezlik sifatlarining yuqori darajada
rivojlanganligi, tezlik va maxsus chidamlilik bo‘lishi kerak.
Tezlik chidamliligini rivojlantirish uchun asos umumiy chidamlilik bo‘lib, uni
rivojlantirish uchun uzoq vaqt va yuqori yuk bilan bajariladigan turli xil mashqlar qo‘llaniladi.
Ilmiy-metodik adabiyotlar tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki, tezlikka chidamlilikni rivojlantirish uchun
mashqlarni yuqori tezlikda bajarish kerak, yugurishda masofa segmentlari yoki
tezlanishlarining umumiy uzunligi yuguruvchining ixtisoslashgan masofasidan kattaroq bo‘lishi
kerak.
Maxsus chidamlilik - muayyan faoliyatga nisbatan chidamlilik (masalan, konkida
uchuvchi, velosipedchi, bokschi, kurashchi va boshqalar uchun maxsus chidamlilik mavjud).
Ushbu turdagi chidamlilikning o‘ziga xosligi ma'lum bir sport turiga xos bo‘lgan mashqlarning
tabiati bilan belgilanadi. Shu bilan birga, 800 m yuguruvchining maxsus chidamliligi doirasida
quyidagi chidamliliklarni ajratish odatiy holdir: kuch, tezlik va muvofiqlashtirish.
Ushbu turdagi chidamlilik bilan bog‘liq yutuqlar yuqori aerob va maksimal anaerob
ko‘rsatkichlarni talab qiladi. Shuni esda tutish kerakki, anaerob qobiliyatni rivojlantirish uchun
asos aerob ko‘rsatkichdir.
Ko‘pincha, mashg‘ulotning asosiy qismida yugurish daqiqali tanaffusdan keyin
bajarilganda yoki integral (murakkab) usulda faqat takroriy usul qo‘llaniladi va yukning
intensivligi tartibga solinmaydi va funksional yuk darajasi faqat mashg‘ulot turiga va ba'zan
sportchining farovonligiga qarab belgilanadi. Maxsus, oldindan rejalashtirilgan tiklash
protseduralari qo‘llanilmaydi. Natijada, o‘rta va uzoq masofalarga yugurishning o‘ziga xos
xususiyatlariga mos keladigan tezlik chidamliligi emas, balki faqat umumiy chidamlilik
rivojlanadi.
Tahlil va naatijalar. Uzoq muddatli tayyorgarlik jarayoni bosqichlarga bo‘linadi:
dastlabki tayyorgarlik (bolalar va o‘smirlar sport maktablarining boshlang‘ich o‘quv guruhlari
- 9-11 yosh), boshlang‘ich ixtisoslashuv (o‘quv va o‘quv guruhlari - 12-15 yosh), yuqori
mutaxassislik (sportni yaxshilash guruhlari - 16-18 yosh), sport mahorati (oliy sport mahorati
guruhlari - 19 yosh).
Ushbu bosqichlarning yosh chegaralari, turli xil yengil atletika guruhlari uchun
tayyorgarlikning vazifalari, vositalari va usullari kichik farqlarga ega va shuning uchun turli
ixtisoslikdagi sportchilar uchun uzoq muddatli mashg‘ulotlarni rejalashtirish va qurish uchun
asos bo‘lishi mumkin. [3,4].
Yengil atletika bo‘yicha zaxiralarni tayyorlash barcha jismoniy tarbiya va sport
tashkilotlarining eng muhim vazifasidir. Bu mashg‘ulotlar asosan bolalar va o‘smirlar sport
maktablarida (DYUSSh), olimpiya zaxiralari ixtisoslashtirilgan bolalar va o‘smirlar sport
maktablarida (SDYUSHOR), olimpiya zaxiralari kollejlarida (KOR), umumta’lim
maktablarining sport sinflarida olib boriladi.

Ko‘plab taniqli yengil atletikachilarni tayyorlash tajribasi shuni ko‘rsatadiki, 9-11
yoshdan boshlab tizimli uzoq muddatli mashg‘ulotlar jarayonida o‘smirlik davrida (16-17 yosh)
yuqori natijalarga erishish mumkin.
DYUSSh, SDYUSShOR, KORda yengil atletika zaxiralarini muvaffaqiyatli tayyorlash
uchun, birinchi navbatda, yosh organizmning o‘sish qonuniyatlarini hisobga olgan holda,
jismoniy, axloqiy va irodaviy ko‘nikmalarni rivojlantirish, keng ko‘lamli harakat malakalarini
shakllantirishga asoslangan bolalar va yoshlar (9-19 yosh) uchun tizimli ko‘p yillik o‘quv,
o‘quv va tarbiya jarayonini tashkil etish zarur. Bu jarayon eng iqtidorli sportchilarga 18-19
yoshgacha xalqaro yutuqlar darajasiga chiqish imkonini beradi. Bu yoshdagi yuqori sport
yutuqlari odatda oqlanadi. Asosiy muammo - bu ularga erishish yo‘lidir.
Yengil atletikada sportchining eng faol va muvaffaqiyatli davri 10-15 yil.
Uzoq muddatli tayyorgarlik jarayoni bosqichlarga bo‘linadi: dastlabki tayyorgarlik
(bolalar va o‘smirlar sport maktablarining boshlang‘ich o‘quv guruhlari - 9-11 yosh),
boshlang‘ich ixtisoslashuv (o‘quv va o‘quv guruhlari - 12-15 yosh), yuqori mutaxassislik
(sportni yaxshilash guruhlari - 16-18 yosh), sport mahorati (oliy sport mahorati guruhlari - 19
yosh).
Ushbu bosqichlarning yosh chegaralari, turli xil yengil atletika guruhlari uchun
tayyorgarlikning vazifalari, vositalari va usullari kichik farqlarga ega va shuning uchun turli
ixtisoslikdagi sportchilar uchun uzoq muddatli mashg‘ulotlarni rejalashtirish va qurish uchun
asos bo‘lishi mumkin.
Mashg‘ulotlarning dastlabki uch bosqichi O‘smirlar sport maktabi, Olimpiya zaxiralari
sport maktabi va KORda tahsil olayotganlarning yoshiga to‘g‘ri keladi. To‘rtinchi bosqich
ko‘proq kattalar sportchilariga tegishli, garchi uning bir qator vazifalari va vositalari kattalar,
yoshlar va o‘smirlar sportchilari bilan ishlashda allaqachon qo‘llanilgan. Amalda, mashg‘ulot
guruhlarining yosh tarkibiga aniq rioya qilish juda qiyin, bu sportchilarning turli xil tabiiy
iste'dodlari va ularning jismoniy tayyorgarligi, shuningdek ularning biologik (pasport emas)
yoshi bilan izohlanadi. Eng yuqori natijalarga erishish uchun kamida 7 - 9 yil sarflash kerak.
Faqat juda iqtidorli talabalar qisqa vaqt ichida o‘quv jarayonini yakunlay oladilar. Biroq,
majburiy, noto‘g‘ri tuzilgan o‘quv jarayoni tufayli iste'dod tezda yo‘q bo‘lib ketishining ko‘plab
misollari mavjud.
Erta yoshda ajoyib natijalarga erishishning keng tarqalgan faktlari (Olimpiada o‘yinlarida
g‘alaba qozonish, jahon rekordlarini o‘rnatish) hali ham qoidadan istisno bo‘lib, engil atletika
turlarining rivojlanishining umumiy naqshlari bilan emas, balki alohida sportchilarning katta
iste'dodi bilan bog‘liq.
Yengil atletika uchun boshlang‘ich yosh chegarasi 9-11 yosh deb belgilanishi mumkin,
ammo bu shu vaqtgacha bola jismoniy tarbiya va sport bilan bog‘liq emas degani emas. Bolalar
bog‘chasida, maktabda, oilada jismoniy tarbiya darslari, sinfdan tashqari mashg‘ulotlar va
o‘yinlar har tomonlama tayyorgarlik uchun zarur poydevor yaratishga yordam beradi. [5].

Ko‘p yillik tayyorgarlik jarayonida yigit va qizlar bir qator yosh bosqichlarini bosib
o‘tadilar. Ko‘pgina davrlashtirishlar uchta guruhga bo‘linishni o‘z ichiga oladi. Shunday qilib,
pedagogika va rivojlanish psixologiyasida qo‘llaniladigan tasnif maktab o‘quvchilarini yosh
avlodning psixologik-pedagogik xususiyatlaridan kelib chiqqan holda guruhlarga ajratadi.
Fiziologik davrlashtirish organizm tizimlarining tuzilishi, rivojlanishi va funktsiyalarining
shakllanishiga asoslanadi. Yengil atletika musobaqalari qoidalarida nazarda tutilgan yosh
guruhlariga bo‘linish, sport maktablarining tayyorgarlik va tayyorgarlik guruhlari bosqichlari
mashg‘ulotlar va musobaqa jarayonlarining empirik tarzda o‘rnatilgan va ma'lum darajada
tasdiqlangan tizimini aks ettiradi.
Chidamlilik, moslashuvchanlik, tezlik va kuchning eng samarali tabiiy rivojlanishining
yosh zonalarini aniqlashda sezilarli farqlar mavjud. Turli tadqiqotlar ma'lumotlarini
umumlashtirgan holda, sportchilarning quyidagi yosh davrlarini jismoniy sifatlarning o‘sish
sur'ati bo‘yicha eng samarali deb hisoblash mumkin.
Chidamlilikni rivojlantirish uchun: aerob qobiliyat (umumiy chidamlilik) - 10 yoshdan
12 yoshgacha va 17-18 yoshda; maxsus chidamlilik (sprint) - 14 yoshdan 16 yoshgacha; anaerob
quvvati (o‘rta va uzoq masofalarga yuguruvchilarning maxsus chidamliligi) - 15 yoshdan 19
yoshgacha;
- tezlik: harakat tezligining ko‘rsatkichi - 9 yoshdan 12 yoshgacha va 14-16 yoshda; bitta
harakat tezligi - 9 yoshdan 13 yoshgacha; vosita reaktsiyasi - 9 yoshdan 19 yoshgacha;
- tezlik-kuchlilik fazilatlari - 9 yoshdan 10 yoshgacha va 14-17 yoshda;
- mutlaq kuch - 14 yoshdan 17 yoshgacha;
- moslashuvchanlik - 7 yoshdan 10 yoshgacha va 13-14 yoshda;
- epchillik - 7 yoshdan 10 yoshgacha va 16 - 17 yoshda.
Bunday dinamika ma'lum darajada uzoq muddatli mashg‘ulotlarning alohida bosqichlari
vazifalarini belgilaydi va jismoniy tayyorgarlikning maxsus poydevorini yaratish, yuqori
natijalarga erishishni ta'minlash va ularni bir necha yil davomida faol sport faoliyati bilan
ta'minlash uchun kalit hisoblanadi.
Dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichi
Yengil atletikachilar uchun dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichi 9-10 yoshda boshlanib, 11-12
yoshda tugaydi. Bolalarning harakat rivojlanishining bu davri tayyorgarlikni va jismoniy
sifatlarni har tomonlama namoyish qilishni talab qiladigan jismoniy mashqlarni bajarishda
natijalarning oshishi bilan tavsiflanadi.
Dastlabki tayyorgarlik guruhlaridagi asosiy vazifalar quyidagilardan iborat: salomatlikni
mustahkamlash, har tomonlama motorli jismoniy tayyorgarlikni (KMP) yaxshilash, poygada
yurishning asosiy motorli ko‘nikmalarini o‘zlashtirish, silliq va to‘siqlar bilan yugurish, turgan
joydan va yugurish bilan sakrash, barcha turdagi uloqtirish (asosan, tik turgan holda, to‘p va
nayza uloqtirishdan tashqari); axloqiy va irodaviy fazilatlarni tarbiyalash. RDP asosida va
yengil atletika harakati asoslarini o‘zlashtirgan holda, bolalarni engil atletikaning beshta asosiy
281

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

guruhida mashg‘ulotlarga tanlash mumkin: sprint va to‘siqlar, chidamlilik yugurish va poyga
yurishlari, sakrash, uloqtirish va ko‘pkurash musobaqalari.
Tadqiqot natijalari: Shunday qilib, bosqichning asosiy maqsadi bolalarni yengil atletika
turlaridan kelib chiqqan holda har tomonlama jismoniy va texnik tayyorgarlikdan o‘tkazish,
so‘ngra ularni turlar guruhlariga ixtisoslashtirish uchun tanlashdir. Faqatgina istisnolar - bu
tayanch sakrash, poygada yurish va nayza uloqtirish bo‘lishi mumkin, ular uchun bu yoshda
bolalarning o‘ziga xos qobiliyatlari juda aniq belgilanishi kerak.
Ixtisoslashuv faqat maqsadi bo‘yicha tor va resurslardan foydalanishda keng bo‘lishi
kerak; Bu tayyorgarlikni majburlashdan qochadi, bu birinchi navbatda tez sur'atda, keyin esa
asta-sekin sport yutuqlarining turg‘unligiga olib keladi (allaqachon 18-19 yoshda).
Ushbu bosqich yengil atletika musobaqalaridan keng foydalanish bilan
shug‘ullanuvchilarning har tomonlama jismoniy va texnik tayyorgarligini ta'minlashi kerak. Bu
bosqichda yosh sportchilarni tayyorlashning asosiy vositasi yengil atletika mashqlari; har
tomonlama jismoniy tarbiya (KPT), irodaviy tayyorgarlik masalalarini hal qiluvchi boshqa sport
turlaridan mashqlar va mashg‘ulotlarning emotsionalligini oshiradigan mashqlar (ochiq
o‘yinlar, gimnastika, akrobatika va boshqalar); asosan ko‘pkurash dasturi bo‘yicha musobaqa
mashg‘ulotlari, shuningdek, nazariy tayyorgarlik.
Bolalar bu yoshda, qoida tariqasida, chempion bo‘lish yoki g‘alaba qozonish maqsadi
bilan emas, balki eng muhimi - mashg‘ulotlar yoki musobaqalardan zavqlanish uchun kelishadi.
Dastlabki mashg‘ulotlar guruhlarini tark etishning sezilarli darajada ko‘rsatkichlari ko‘pincha
monotonlik va sinflarning bir xilligi bilan bog‘liq. Shuning uchun boshlang‘ich mashg‘ulot
guruhlarida emotsionallikni oshirish mashqlari - faol va sport o‘yinlari, gimnastika va
akrobatika mashqlari - umumiy mashg‘ulot hajmining 20% gacha (vaqt bo‘yicha) olishi kerak.
Ushbu mashqlar bir vaqtning o‘zida RFP muammolarini hal qiladi. Umumiy jismoniy tarbiya
va texnik tayyorgarlik uchun resurslar hajmi taxminan 60% bo‘lishi kerak. Qolgan 20% SFP,
musobaqalarda ishtirok etish, sinov va nazorat mashqlari va mashg‘ulotlar uchun asosiy atletika
mashqlarini bajarish uchun ajratiladi. Birinchi yilda boshlang‘ich o‘quv guruhlarida haftasiga 3
marta 90 daqiqadan, ikkinchisida haftasiga 3 marta 100 daqiqadan, uchinchisida esa haftasiga
4 marta 100-120 daqiqadan o‘qish tavsiya etiladi.
Bu yoshda bolalarni yugurishni o‘z ichiga olishi kerak bo‘lgan ertalabki maxsus atletika
mashqlari to‘plamini bajarishga o‘rgatish kerak.
Mashg‘ulot jarayonida murabbiydan dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichida juda xilma-xil
bo‘lgan test va nazorat mashqlarini tizimli ravishda o‘tkazish talab qilinadi. Sinov
ko‘rsatkichlarining dinamikasi engil atletikaning ayrim turlari bilan shug‘ullanish uchun
sportchilarni tanlash mezonlaridan biri bo‘ladi. Sinov yiliga 2-4 marta o‘tkazilishi kerak.
Birinchisi tayyorgarlik davrining boshida - sentyabr-oktyabr oylarida, ikkinchisi - dekabr
oyining o‘rtalarida, uchinchisi - may oyida, yozgi startlar boshlanishidan oldin, to‘rtinchisi musobaqa davrining oxirida (iyul - avgust oyining boshi).

Dastlabki tayyorgarlik guruhlaridagi mashg‘ulotlarning muhim vazifasi yosh
sportchilarni sezilarli jismoniy va ruhiy stressga bardosh berish qobiliyatini o‘rgatishdir. Bunga
musobaqalar tizimi va ayniqsa, aylanma mashqlarni qo‘llash orqali erishiladi. Yana bir muhim
vazifa – yengil atletika musobaqalarida ratsional texnika asoslarini o‘rgatish va yaxshi harakat
maktabini yaratishdir. Shu bilan birga, mashg‘ulotlar doimo guruhlarda, ortiqcha
individualizatsiyasiz bo‘lishi kerak.
Boshlang‘ich maktab yoshida bolalar murakkab harakatlar texnikasini egallash
qobiliyatiga ega. Ular yangi mashqlarga yaxshi javob berishadi, lekin ko‘pincha ular eng esda
qolarli tafsilotlarni ta'kidlaydilar. Bolalar harakatlarini tahlil qilishda qiyinchiliklarga duch
kelishadi. Yangi shartli ulanishlar tez hosil bo‘ladi, lekin farqlash qiyinroq. Shuning uchun
yengil atletika musobaqalari texnikasini o`rgatishda yaxlit o`qitish metodidan foydalanish
afzalroqdir. Bu yosh sportchilarga mashqning asosiy nuqtalarini o‘rganish imkonini beradi. 912 yoshdagi bolalarning diqqati juda yomon rivojlangan. Darhol bajarib bo‘lmaydigan mashqqa
doimiy qiziqish, agar mashg‘ulot hissiy, ko‘rgazmali qurollar bilan qo‘llab-quvvatlansa va
o‘qituvchi-trener tomonidan baholansagina paydo bo‘ladi.
Mashqlarni bajarish texnikasini nazorat qilish isinish va umumiy rivojlanish mashqlari
bilan amalga oshirilishi kerak. Kuzatish predmeti sportchining holati bo‘lishi kerak - elkalari va
bilaklarining erkin holati, oyoqning erga yuqoridan pastgacha va qat'iy ravishda bo‘ylama
yo‘nalishda, burilmasdan joylashishi.
Issiqlik oxirida amalga oshirilgan tezlashtirishlar alohida ahamiyatga ega. Ularni amalga
oshirish jarayonida erkinlik va harakatlanish qulayligini, oyoqning holatini va erga joylashishini
kuzatish kerak.
Asosiy mashqlarni bajarishda yosh sportchilar birinchi navbatda harakatning asosiy etakchi - elementlarini o‘zlashtirishga e'tibor berishlari kerak. Sportni takomillashtirish
jarayonida, tayyorgarlik darajasi oshgani sayin, texnika ko‘proq individuallashtirishga
o‘zgaradi. Shuning uchun yosh sportchilarga texnikaning to‘g‘ri asoslarini o‘rgatish kerak,
buning asosida ular keyinchalik o‘z texnikasini takomillashtirishni davom ettirishlari mumkin.
Harakatlarni erkin va bo‘shashmasdan bajarish qobiliyati sportchilarning texnik
tayyorgarligida katta rol o‘ynaydi. Murabbiylar, ayniqsa, dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichida,
bolalarga dam olish qobiliyatini o‘rgatishlari kerak - tik turganda, o‘tirganda va yotganda, keyin
esa yugurish, sakrash, uloqtirish va yurish paytida harakatda.
9-11 yoshgacha bo‘lgan bolalar 12-13 yoshli bolalarga qaraganda tezlikni, ayniqsa
harakatlarning chastotasi va yugurish tezligini rivojlantirish uchun qulayroq imkoniyatlarga
ega. Shuning uchun mashg‘ulot paytida tezlikning ushbu komponentlarini - harakatlar
chastotasini va yugurish tezligini aniq ishlab chiqish kerak. Tez harakat qilish qobiliyati
odamlarda genetik jihatdan aniqlanadi. 12-13 yoshga kelib, asabiy jarayonlarning tezligi va
harakatchanligi deyarli kattalar organizmi darajasiga etadi. Demak, tezlikning namoyon
bo‘lishida genetik jihatdan aniqlangan imkoniyatlarni ro‘yobga chiqarish, demak, tegishli
tadbirlarda sport natijalariga erishishda uning tarkibiy qismlarini takomillashtirish muhim omil
283

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

hisoblanadi. Dastlabki bosqichlarda - harakatlar chastotasi va tempining rivojlanishi, keyin 1416 yoshda - tezlik-kuch sifatlari va mushaklarning kuchi, 15-17 yoshda - maxsus chidamlilik.
Dastlabki tayyorgarlik guruhlarida tezlikni rivojlantirishning eng samarali vositasi faol va sport
o‘yinlari, boshqariladigan tezlikda tez yugurish, estafeta poygalari, sakrash va sakrash
mashqlari, tosh va engil narsalarni uloqtirish bo‘ladi.
Dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichida kuch va tezlik-kuch sifatlarini rivojlantirish katta
ahamiyatga ega. 9-11 yoshda bolalarning kuch sifatlarini umumiy rivojlanish mashqlari
yordamida yaxshilash mumkin. Bu universalizm birinchi bir yarim-ikki yil ichida seziladi.
Keyingi davrlarda kuch va tezlik-kuch sifatlarini yanada ixtisoslashtirilgan tarzda rivojlantirish
kerak. Kuchni oshirish mashqlari minimal kuch bilan bajarilishi kerak, kuchlanishni istisno
qilish, shuningdek, mushaklarning maksimal kuchlanishi. Kuchni rivojlantirish uchun akrobatik
mashqlar, apparatlarda gimnastika mashqlari va engil vaznli mashqlar (o‘z tana vaznining
uchdan bir qismidan yarmigacha) tavsiya etiladi.
Dastlabki tayyorgarlik guruhlarida harakat epchilligini rivojlantirish, ayniqsa, o‘yin va
kros mashg‘ulotlarida, shuningdek, yengil atletika musobaqalari texnikasini o‘rgatish va uni
takomillashtirish bo‘yicha mashg‘ulotlarda katta ahamiyatga ega. Mashqlarni bajarishning
yangi usullarini o‘zlashtirish harakatlarni muvofiqlashtirish qobiliyatini oshiradi, ya'ni
epchillikni rivojlantiradi. Buning uchun g‘ayrioddiy sharoitlarda, boshlang‘ich pozitsiyasini
o‘zgartirganda, bajarish usulini o‘zgartirganda (masalan, orqaga sakrash, cheksiz yugurish bilan
sakrash, chap qo‘l bilan uloqtirish, parvozda yangi harakatlarni bajarish) qo‘llaniladi.
Chaqqonlikning muhim tarkibiy qismlari "muvozanat hissi", "vaqt tuyg‘usi", "uskunalar
tuyg‘usi" bo‘lib, o‘qituvchini bolalarning bu qobiliyatlarini atletika mashg‘ulotlarining birinchi
davridayoq rivojlantirishga majbur qiladi.
Bolalarda chaqqonlikni rivojlantirish bilan bir qatorda, moslashuvchanlikni rivojlantirish
kerak. 7-8 yoshda bolalar bo‘g‘imlarida yaxshi moslashuvchanlik va harakatchanlikka ega; 1113 yoshga kelib, bu fazilatlar, ayniqsa, kuchaygan bolalarda yo‘qoladi. Moslashuvchanlikni
rivojlantirish uchun, birinchi navbatda, to‘siqli yugurishdan foydalanish kerak va ko‘pchilik
maxsus va asosiy mashqlarni katta amplituda bilan bajarish kerak; predmetlar bilan maxsus
mashqlar, gimnastika devorida, akrobatik cho‘zish mashqlari (bo‘linish, yarim bo‘linish,
ko‘priklar, to‘siqli qadam holatida kuch mashqlari, o‘tirgan va tik turgan holda turli egilishlar)
mashg‘ulotlarga, ayniqsa tayyorgarlik qismida, moslashuvchanlikni oshirish uchun kiritilishi
kerak. Moslashuvchanlikni rivojlantirish uchun mashqlar tizimli ravishda bajarilishi va
ertalabki mashqlarga ham, asosiy mashg‘ulotlarga ham kiritilishi kerak.
Chidamlilikni rivojlantirish dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichida alohida ahamiyatga ega.
Aynan chidamlilik mashqlarida yosh sportchilar katta jismoniy va ruhiy stressni engib o‘tishga
duch kelishadi. Chidamlilik mashqlari yengil atletikachilarning jismoniy ko‘rsatkichlarini
oshiradi, bu esa keyinchalik ularga yugurish, sakrash, uloqtirish, ko‘pkurash va poyga
yurishlarida katta hajmdagi o‘quv yuklarini bajarishga yordam beradi.

Bolalarda aerobik qobiliyatlarni rivojlantirish katta ahamiyatga ega bo‘lib, bu kislorodni
tashish tizimining funktsiyalarini oshirishga olib keladi (kislorod iste'moli, o‘pka
ventilyatsiyasining kuchayishi, mushaklarning kapillyarizatsiyasi, kisloroddan foydalanish,
yurak faoliyatini tejash va yurak mushaklarining kuchayishi).
9-11 yoshdagi bolalarda aerobik rejim uzoq yugurish paytida yurak urish tezligi
ma'lumotlari asosida aniqlanishi mumkin: o‘g‘il bolalar uchun 170-175 gacha va qizlar uchun
175-180 urish / min. Bu ko‘rsatkichlar kattalar sportchilarinikidan bir oz yuqoriroq, chunki
bolalarda yurak urish tezligi kattalarnikidan oshadi.
Dastlabki mashg‘ulot bosqichida umumiy chidamlilikni (aerob qobiliyatini) rivojlantirish
uchun uzoq masofalarga yugurish, sport o‘yinlari, chang‘i, suzish, yo‘lda yugurish, tog‘larda
uzoq yurish sayohatlari qo‘llaniladi.
Anaerob qobiliyatlar (sprinterlar, to‘siqlar, sakrashlar, uloqtiruvchilar, o‘rta masofaga
yuguruvchilarning maxsus chidamliligi) musobaqa mashqlari, sakrash, uloqtirish va boshqa
tezlikni kuchaytirish mashqlarini ketma-ket bajarish orqali rivojlantiriladi.
Ko‘pgina murabbiylarning katta xatosi - bu anaerob qobiliyatlarni rivojlantiradigan
o‘qitish usullari bilan shug‘ullanishdir, chunki bu deyarli har doim tananing majburiy
rivojlanishiga olib keladi.
Musobaqa kalendar. Yuqorida aytib o‘tilganidek, bolalar vaqtni qiziqarli o‘tkazish uchun
sport bilan shug‘ullanishadi, shuning uchun musobaqalar dastlabki bosqichlardayoq yengil
atletikachilarni tayyorlashda katta rol o‘ynashi kerak. Musobaqa jarayonida ishtirokchilarning
qiziqishlari qiziqarli dam olishdan maqsadli tayyorgarlikka va yuqori sport natijalariga
erishishga yo‘naltiriladi.
Boshlang‘ich maktab guruhlarida o‘quv yilini 1 sentyabrdan boshlash tavsiya etiladi.
Musobaqalar quyidagi ketma-ketlikda o‘tkazilishi kerak: sentyabr - 2-3 kros startlari;
Dekabr - 2-3 ko‘pkurashlarda boshlanadi; Aprel - 2-3 kros startlari, 1-2 individual
musobaqalarda start; Iyun va iyul oyining boshlarida - ko‘pkurashda 2-3, individual
musobaqalarda 2-3 boshlanadi. Yo‘l va o‘rmon yugurishlari noyabr va mart oylarida o‘tkazilishi
mumkin. Oktyabr, noyabr, fevral va mart oylarida siz maqsadli mashg‘ulotlarga e'tibor
qaratishingiz kerak.
Xulosa. Yengil atletikachilarning dastlabki ixtisoslashuv bosqichi 12-13 yoshdan
boshlanib, 15-16 yoshgacha davom etadi. Bu yoshdagi yosh sportchilar O‘smirlar sport
maktabi, Olimpiya zaxiralari sport maktabi o‘quv guruhlari, KOR va maxsus to‘garaklarga jalb
etilgan. Bolalarning motorli rivojlanishining bu davri jismoniy tayyorgarlik ko‘rsatkichlarining
notekis o‘sishi va balog‘at yoshining tugashi (qizlarda 12-13 yoshda, o‘g‘il bolalarda 14-15
yoshda) bilan eng aniq tavsiflanadi.
Dastlabki tayyorgarlik bosqichidan boshlang‘ich mutaxassislik bosqichiga o‘tishda
murabbiy jismoniy rivojlanish va tayyorgarlik darajasini, sportchining pasporti va biologik
yoshini, uning ortib borayotgan mashg‘ulot yuklarini ko‘tarish qobiliyatini hisobga olishi kerak.

Kirish. Zamonaviy sport tizimi nafaqat jismoniy tayyorgarlik, balki sportchilarning
psixologik barqarorligi, muloqotga layoqati va madaniyatlararo muhitda samarali faoliyat yurita
olish qobiliyatiga ham asoslanadi. Bu jarayonda sotsiolingvistik kompetensiya alohida
ahamiyat kasb etadi - ya’ni sportchining turli ijtimoiy va madaniy kontekstlarda til va muloqot
vositalaridan to‘g‘ri foydalanish qobiliyati. Mazkur kompetensiyaning shakllanishiga esa
insonning shaxsiy xususiyatlari, hissiy intellekti, ijtimoiy tajribasi va kognitiv
moslashuvchanligi kuchli ta’sir ko‘rsatadi.
Adabiyotlar tahlili. Bu masalada dunyo va mahalliy psixologlarning fikrlari juda
muhimdir. L.S. Vigotskiy, S.L. Rubinshteyn, B.F. Lomov, A.N. Leontyev, A.A. Bodalev kabi
rus olimlari muloqot va shaxslararo munosabatlarning psixologik asoslarini chuqur tadqiq
etganlar. Abu Nasr Forobiy o‘zining “Jamiyatni o‘rganish haqidagi kitobi”da muloqot
madaniyati va notiqlik san’atining jamiyat taraqqiyotidagi o‘rnini ta’kidlagan. Jaloliddin
Davoniy esa axloqiy yetuklik va inson fazilatlarini muloqot jarayoni bilan chambarchas
bog‘lagan. O‘zbek psixologlaridan E.G‘oziyev, M.G. Davletshin, V.M. Karimova, N.Safoyev
singari olimlar ham muloqotning nazariy va amaliy asoslarini tahlil qilganlar. Ularning ilmiy
qarashlari asosida sportchilarni sotsiolingvistik kompetensiyaga yo‘naltirish orqali ularning
sportdagi muvaffaqiyatlari oshirilishi mumkinligi ta’kidlanadi.
Zamonaviy sport muhitida sportchilar va murabbiylar o‘rtasida samarali muloqot sport
faoliyatidagi muvaffaqiyatlarning asoslaridan biri hisoblanadi. Muloqot - sport faoliyati
sub'ektlari o‘rtasida o‘zaro tushunishga olib keladigan ikki tomonlama ma'lumot almashish
jarayoni. Muloqot - lotin tilidan tarjima qilinganda "hamma bilan umumiy" degan ma'noni
anglatadi. Agar o‘zaro tushunishga erishilmasa, u holda muloqot muvaffaqiyatsiz deb
hisoblanadi. Muloqot muvaffaqiyatini ta'minlash uchun odamlar sizni qanday tushunishganligi,
288

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

sizni qanday qabul qilishlari va muammoga qanday aloqasi borligi haqida fikr bildirishingiz
kerak. Bunday holatda sotsiolingvistik kompitentlikka egalik vaziyatlarda ustunlikni yuzaga
chiqaradi. Sotsiolingvistik kompetentsiya madaniyat va ijtimoiy me'yorlar kabi omillarni
hisobga olgan holda turli ijtimoiy kontekstlarda tildan to‘g'ri foydalanish qobiliyatini anglatadi.
Demak bu muloqot jarayonida zaruriy bilim va ko‘nikmalar ekanligidan ham bilishimiz
mumkinki, sportchilar uchun sotsiolingvistik kompetentsiyasi rivojlantirishi ayniqsa muhimdir,
chunki sport ko‘pincha turli xil odamlar guruhlarini o‘z ichiga oladi. Psixologik omillarning
ushbu kompetentsiyaga qanday ta'sir qilishini tushunish sportchilarga nafaqat maydonda, balki
boshqalar, jumladan, jamoadoshlari, murabbiylari va kengroq sport jamoatchiligi bilan o‘zaro
munosabatlarida ham yaxshi natijalarga erishishga yordam beradi.
Sport faoliyati sub’ektlari o‘rtasidagi shaxslararo muloqotda muloqotning xususiyatlari
bir qator omillar bilan belgilanadi. Har qanday guruh, jamoa a'zolari, birgalikdagi faoliyat
vazifalarini bajaradilar, bir-birlari bilan ikki turdagi munosabatlar bilan bog'lanadilar:
maqom-rol (biznes, rasmiy, mas'uliyatli bog'liqlik munosabatlari) va
shaxslararo (hissiy, norasmiy, nofaollik).
Sportchilarning sotsiolingvistik kompetentsiyasini shakllantiradigan psixologik
xususiyatlarga shaxsiy xususiyatlar, ijtimoiy tajribalar, hissiy intellekt va kognitiv
moslashuvchanlik ta'sir qiladi. Samarali sotsiolingvistik kompetentsiyaga hissa qo‘shadigan
asosiy psixologik xususiyatlarni aniqlash uchun tilshunoslik, psixologiya va sport fanlari
sohasidagi mavjud adabiyotlarni har tomonlama ko‘rib chiqish lozim. Sport faoliyatidagi ko‘p
madaniyatlilik sport jarayonidagi dinamika va turli madaniy qatlamdagi sportchilar o‘rtasidagi
samarali muloqotni kuchaytirishda muhim o‘rin egallaydi. Globallashuv kuchaygan sari, barcha
jabhalarda turli madaniy va lingvistik qatlamdan kelgan sportchilarning samarali muloqot va
hamkorligini shakllantirishda yangi imkoniyatlar va qiyinchiliklarni yuzaga keltiradi. Ko‘p
madaniyatli ta’lim, tenglik, madaniyatlararo tushuncha va inklyuzivlikni rivojlantirishga
qaratilgan bo‘lib, turli nuqtai nazarlarni sportchi faoliyati jarayonida integratsiya qilish orqali
amalga oshiriladi (Caldeborg, 2022). Turli madaniy kelib chiqishga ega sportchilar o‘rtasidagi
o‘zaro ta’sir natijasida til, xulq-atvor va kognitiv moslashuvchanlikni o‘z ichiga olgan
madaniyatlararo kompetensiya shakllanadi. Bunday muhitda samarali muloqot nafaqat til
bilimi, balki sotsiolingvistik va pragmatik kompetensiyani ham talab etadi. Bu sportchilar uchun
turli madaniy muhitda muloqotni muvaffaqiyatli olib borish imkonini yaratadi (Obiakor, 2023).
Ko‘p madaniyatli muhitdagi muloqot kognitiv va til o‘sishi uchun katalizator bo‘lib xizmat
qilishini ko‘rsatadi. Shuningdek, Chung & Fung (2024) tomonidan ilgari surilgan
kommunikativ kompetensiya modeli madaniyatlararo muloqotda grammatik aniqlik va
kontekstual moslikni birdek muhim deb hisoblaydi. Jamoaviy sportlar esa, real vaqtda qaror
qabul qilish, strategik muvofiqlik va jamoaviy hamkorlikni talab qilgani bois, bunday muhitda
muloqot yanada muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi (Flory va boshq., 2024). [1].

samarali muloqotni rivojlantirish xususidagi masalalar bilan shugullangan olimlar. Psixologik

tadqiqotlarda muomila maromlari muammosi bir nechta yo‘nalishlarda talqin etiladi: Rus
olimlari L.S.Vigotskiy, L.S.Rubinshteyn, B.M.Teplov, B.F.Lomov, A.B.Brushlinskiy,
N.S.Leytes, M.Xolodnaya, V.S.Merlin, Ye.A.Klimov N.I.Chuprikova, chet el psixologiyasida
muomila maromlari A.Bine, J.Piaje, Ch.Spirmen, Tyorstoun, Gilford, G.Ayzenk, R.B.Kettell,
R.Sternberglar tadqiq etilgan. Shuningdek, mahalliy olimlar M.G.Davletshin, B.R.Qodirov,
E.Gʻ.Gʻoziyev,
V.M.Karimova,
Gʻ.B.Shoumarov,
E.Z.Usmonova,
R.I.Sunnatova,
Z.T.Nishonovalarning izlanishlari hamda mutafakkirlarimiz Forobiy, Beruniy, Davoniy, Ibn
Sino, Abdulla Avloniy va boshqalarning fikrlarida iqtidorlilikni tashkil etuvchi omillar turlicha
talqin etilgan.
Inson ozining ongli hayoti davomida nimayiki qilmasin, uning asosida psixologik
jarayonlar yotadi. Buni esa qadimgi sharqning buyuk insonlari mo‘tabar mutafakkirlari
oldindan anglar edilar. Buyuk mutafakkir Abu Nasr Farobiy yaqin va o‘rta sharq ijtimoiyfalsafiy oqim asoschilaridan biri bo‘lib “Sharq Aristoteli” degan unvonga sazovor bo‘lgan.
Uning muloqot haqidagi qarashlari “Jamiyatni o‘rganish haqidagi kitob” asarida o‘z ifodasini
topgan. Unda insonlar atrofidagilar bilan muloqotda dilkashlik va hushmuomilalik, hamda
notiqlik san’atini yaxshi egallagan bo‘lishi lozimligi haqida takidlagan.
Sharqning yana bir buyuk allomalaridan biri Jaloliddin Davoniy o‘zining Axloqi Jaloliy
asarida insonning kamoloti uchun zarur bo‘ladigan fazilatlar xususida so‘z yuritgan. Asar uch
qismdan iborat:axloq,odamning ichki holati hamda siyosiy –ijtimoiy masalalar.[2]
Mamlakatimizda o‘nlab sport federatsiyalari, assotsiatsiyalari, Davlat qo‘mitalari faoliyat
ko‘rsatib kelmoqda. Futbol, hokkey, voleybol boks, tennis, shaxmat, chang‘ida uchish, sharq
yakka kurashlarida inson omili yetakchi ro‘l o‘ynaydi. Chunki sportchining jangovorligi,
kayfiyati, irodasi, hotirjamligi,o‘zini- o‘zi iroda qila olish hamda to‘gri muloqot qila olish
ko‘nikmasi g‘alaba keltiradi, uning aks holati esa mag‘lubiyat manbaidir. Sport jamoalarida
shaxslararo munosabatlar maromini aniqlash, jamoa liderlarini topish, raxbar, trener va
sportchilar orasidagi munosabatlarni aniqlash, jamoa a’zolari o‘rtasida o‘zaro moslik,
tushunish,yordam va hamkorlik faoliyatini tashkil etish borasidagi amaliy psixologik tavsiyalar
sportchilarning muvoffaqiyatga erishishi uchun keng imkoniyatlarni ochadi. [6, 257].
Shaxslararo munosabatlarda muomilaning inson psixik holatiga ta’siri masalalari
yuzasidan psixolog olimlar L.S.Vigotskiy, S.L.Rubinshteyn, A.N. Leontyev, B.G.Ananyev,
A.V. Zaporojets, A.A.Bodalev,.FLomov, A.A.Leontyev, M.I.Lisina tadqiqot ishlari olib
borgan. Muloqot inson hayoti va faoliyatining muhim shartidir. Shaxsning tafakkuri olamni va
o‘zining obrazini tahliq qilish va baholash qobiliyati muloqot jarayonida shakllanadi. A.V.
Petrovskiy tahriri ostida chiqqan “umumiy psixologiya” muloqot ikki va undan ortiq kishilar
o‘rtasidagi axborot ayrboshlash, o‘zaro ta’sir va bir- birini tushunishdan iborat jarayon sifatida
e’tirof etilgan. Kommunikativ jarayonda qollaniladigan bir necha belgilar tizimi mavjud. Ular
-verbal kommunikatsiya (nutq orqali va noverbal (nutq bilan bogliq bolmaydigan,
belgilar orqali).
290

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

-noverbal kommunikatsiya vositalariga yuz ifodasi, mimika, ohang, pauza, poza(holat),
ko‘z yosh, kulgu va boshqalar kiradi. Bu vositalar verbal kommunikatsiya-so‘zni to‘ldiradi,
kuchaytiradi va ba’zan uning o‘rnini bosadi. Bolgarlarda boshni qimirlatish yo‘q degani,
ruslarda esa aksincha. Turli yosh guruhlarida noverbal kommunikatsiya turlicha bo‘ladi.
Masalan, bolalar kattalarga ta’sir o‘tkazish vositasi sifatida yig‘idan foydalanadilar. Axborotni
so‘z bilan bayon etishning mazmuni noverbal kommunikatsiya vositalaring mos kelishi
muomila madaniyatining bir turidir. [3.115]
Shaxs rivojlanishida muloqotning roli to‘g‘risida psixologlar A.A.Lyublinskaya,
D.B.Elkoninlar bolada o‘yin faoliyati orqali muloqotning shakllanishini ta’kidlaydilar. Muloqot
orqali shaxsning xarakteri, irodaviy sifatlari shakllanishi haqida P.Y.Galperin, N.F.Dobro‘nin,
N.F.Talizinalar o‘zlarining tadqiqotlarini o‘tkazganlar.
Shuningdek,
Respublikamiz
psixologlaridan
M.G.Davletshin,
E.G‘oziyev,
N.P.Anikeyeva, N.Safoyev kabilar muloqot muammosini turli tomondan yoritib berganlar.
Jumladan, professor E.G‘oziyev “Muomala psixologiyasi” o‘quv qo‘llanmasida muloqotning
barcha qirralarini nazariy tomondan ochib berishga harakat qilgan. Professor M.G.Davletshin
ham “Umumiy psixologiya” o‘quv qo‘llanmasida muloqotni kishilarda qanday shakllanishi
haqida fikrlar bildirgan. Ta’lim - bu avvalo axborot jarayonidir. Muloqotga xilma xil ta’riflar
berilgan bo‘lib, psixolog V.M.Karimovaning “Ijtimoiy psixologiya” darsligida unga
quyidagicha ta’rif bergan: Muloqot – odamlarning birgalikdagi faoliyatlari ehtiyojlaridan kelib
chiqadigan turli faolliklari mobaynida bir-birlari bilan o‘zaro munosabatlarga kirishish
jarayonidir. Muloqot – bu insonlarning hamkorlikdagi faoliyatiga bo‘lgan ehtiyoji bo‘lib,
munosabatlar, o‘zaro ta’sirlar, ma’lumot hamda axborot almashishga doir ularning birgalikdagi
faoliyatidir. Rus psixologlaridan A.N.Leontiyev o‘zining “Psixika taraqqiyotidan ocherklar”
kitobida muloqotning uchinchi shakli – avlodlar o‘rtasidagi muloqotning ahamiyati to‘g‘risida
shunday deb yozadi: “Agar barcha katta avlod o‘lib ketganda, insoniyat turi yo‘q bo‘lib
ketmasdi, lekin jamiyatning taraqqiyoti ancha orqaga surilibgina emas, balki yo‘qolib ham
ketishi mumkin edi”. Darhaqiqat, avlodlararo muloqot tufayli har bir alohida jamiyatning o‘z
madaniyati, madaniy boyliklari, qadriyatlari mavjud bo‘ladiki, buning ahamiyatini tushungan
insoniyatning eng ilg‘or vakillari uni doimo keyingi avlodlar uchun saqlab keladilar hamda
ta’lim tarbiya va kundalik muloqot jarayonida uni avloddan-avlodga uzatadilar. Sportchilarni
muloqotga o‘rgatish uchun ularga muloqot jarayonida yoshlar faoliyatini kuzatish, fikrlashini
aniqlash va shu jarayonda psixologik o‘yinlar, mashqlar, treninglardan foydalanish muhimdir.
Har bir sportchi o‘z jamoasida u yoki bu maqomga ega. Odatda, jamoadagi eng yuqori
maqomni yetakchi futbolchilar, eng kuchli sportchilar, eng pastini esa yosh yoki yangi jamoa
aʼzolari, hali oʻzini koʻrsatmagan zahiradagi futbolchilar egallaydi. Jamoada to‘g‘ridan-to‘g'ri
emotsional aloqalarni aks ettiruvchi ikkinchi turdagi munosabatlar (yoqish, befarqlik yoki
dushmanlik), odatda har qanday guruhda, hamkasblarning insoniy fazilatlari, xulq-atvori va
harakatlarini o‘zaro baholash va qo‘shma baholash natijasida yuzaga keladi, eng ko‘p hollarda
ularning professional va sport faoliyatlaridan tashqari. Shuni ta’kidlash lozimki, munosabatlarni
291

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

biznes va emotsional deb ajratish shartli hisoblanadi. Aslida, do‘stona yoki dushmanlik
munosabatlari aynan birgalikdagi faoliyat davomida shakllanadi, guruhning topshiriqni qanday
hal qilayotganiga qarab. Shuningdek, sportda yuqori yutuqlarning ahamiyati tufayli,
sportchilarning birgalikdagi faoliyatlari va biznes munosabatlari har doim kuchli emotsional
ifodalar va sheriklar bilan shaxsiy munosabatlarni faol shakllantirish bilan bog'liqdir.
Kommunikatsiya jarayonida murabbiy va sportchilar faqat axborot almashish bilan emas,
balki uning to‘g'ri tushunilishini ham ta’minlash vazifasiga duch keladilar. Kommunikativ ta'sir
faqat kommunikator (axborot yuboruvchi shaxs) va qabul qiluvchi (axborotni qabul qiluvchi
shaxs) o‘rtasida yagona yoki o‘xshash kodlash va dekodlash tizimi mavjud bo‘lganda mumkin
bo‘ladi. Ya'ni, shaxslararo kommunikatsiyada kommunikator tomonidan qabul qiluvchiga
yuborilgan xabarning talqin qilinishi maxsus muammo sifatida ajralib turadi.
Sotsiolingvistik kompetensiya vaziyatga moslashuvchanlikni va og'zaki va noverbal
kommunikatsiya vositalaridan foydalanish mahoratini talab qiladi. ta'sirning ma'lum bir
vaziyatlarida samarali kommunikatsiyani qurish uchun zarur bo‘lgan ichki resurslar tizimi
sifatida qaraladi. Sport faoliyati bilan shug‘ullanuvchilarda sotsiolingtvistik kompetensiyasi
faqatgina samarali kommunikatsiyani tashkil etish uchun zarur bo‘lgan bilimlar, ko‘nikmalar
va qobiliyatlar to‘plami bilan belgilanmaydi. Bir xil vaziyatda bo‘lishi va jamoada taxminan bir
xil statusga ega bo‘lishi mumkin bo‘lgan hamkorlar o‘rtasidagi kommunikatsiya, shunga
qaramay, sezilarli darajada farq qilishi mumkin. Ba'zi holatlarda, bu farqlarni sportchilarning
individual psixologik va shaxsiy xususiyatlarini bilmasdan tushuntirish mumkin emas. Aynan
sportchilar, murabbiylar va boshqalar kabi shaxslarning kommunikativ xulq-atvor xususiyatlari
bu masalada hal qiluvchi rol o‘ynaydi.
Xulosa qilib aytadigan bo‘lsak, sportchilarning sotsiolingvistik kompetensiyasini
rivojlantirish nafaqat samarali axborot almashinuvi va jamoadagi barqaror muhitni ta’minlaydi,
balki sport faoliyatida yuqori natijalarga erishish uchun zarur bo‘lgan psixologik va
kommunikativ tayyorgarlikni ham mustahkamlaydi. Bu kompetensiya shaxsiy fazilatlar,
madaniy qadriyatlar va jamoaviy o‘zaro aloqalarning uyg‘unligini talab qiladi. Ayniqsa,
murabbiy va sportchilar o‘rtasida yuzaga keladigan ijtimoiy va emotsional munosabatlar
muloqot orqali shakllanadi va ushbu jarayonni chuqur anglash sotsiolingvistik bilimlarga
asoslanadi.Mazkur yo‘nalishdagi tadqiqotlarda Forobiy, Davoniy, Vigotskiy, Rubinshteyn,
Leontyev, E.G‘oziyev, Davletshin kabi olimlarning fikrlari sportchilar muloqot madaniyatini
shakllantirishda nazariy va amaliy asos bo‘lib xizmat qiladi. Ayniqsa, ko‘p madaniyatli sport
muhitida noverbal va verbal kommunikatsiya vositalarining uyg‘unligi, hissiy intellekt va
ijtimoiy moslashuvchanlik kabi psixologik jihatlar sportchining o‘z jamoasida muvaffaqiyatli
faoliyat yuritishini ta’minlaydi. Shunday ekan, sotsiolingvistik kompetensiyani rivojlantirish
sport psixologiyasi, tilshunoslik va madaniyatshunoslik fanlari chorrahasida joylashgan muhim
tadqiqot yo‘nalishi sifatida dolzarbligini saqlab qolmoqda.

Кириш. Спорт амалиётида кўп йиллик спорт машғулоти босқичма-босқич амалга
ошириладиган узоқ муддатли педагогик жараён бўлиб, унинг самарадорлиги нафақат
замонавий ўргатиш методлари, воситалари ва илғор инновацион технологиялардан
фойдаланишга боғлиқдир, балки ушбу жараённи назорат қилиш, баҳолаш ва олинган
натижалар асосида тайёргарлик дастурига мувофиқ ўзгартиришлар киритиш чоралари
билан ҳам белгиланади.
Рақобат борган сари кескинлашиб бораётган бугунги волейболда юксак
натижаларга эришиш узоқ муддатли шиддатли машғулотлар ва мусобақа ўйинлари
давомида жисмоний ҳамда техник-тактик тайёргарлик даражасини туширмаслик,
қўлланиладиган юкламаларни “енгил” ўзлаштиришга имкон яратувчи функционал
имкониятларга асосланади. Бу борада ҳар бир волейболчининг жисмоний иш
қобилиятини мақсадли шакллантириш ва йиллик тайёргарлик цикллари давомида унинг
самарадорлигини сақлаб қолиш имкониятларини яратиш алоҳида аҳамиятга эгадир.
Лекин, ушбу жараёнларни ташкил этишда волейболчиларнинг ёши ва тайёргарлик
босқичларини эътиборга олиш талаб этилади. Мувофиқ тайёргарлик босқичларида турли
йўналишли машғулотларни ўтказиш, жисмоний сифатлар ва техник-тактик ҳаракатларни
шакллантириш, шу жумладан иш қобилияти ва унинг функционал компонентларини
сайқал топтиришда йиллик тайёргарлик жараёнининг даврлари (тайёргарлик, мусобақа
ва ўтиш даврлари) ва ҳар бир даврнинг босқичлари (УЖТ, МЖТ, МОТ, мусобақа,
ўтиш)га асосланиш фойдали натижаларга эришиш пойдеворидир [1]. Йиллик
тайёргарлик жараёнининг ҳар бир даври ва босқичларида тайёргарлик турлари
(жисмоний, техник-тактик, функционал тайёргарлик), шу жумладан умумий ва махсус
жисмоний иш қобилиятининг шаклланиш динамикасини объектив тестлар ёрдамида
назорат қилиб бориш ва баҳолаш алоҳида аҳамият касб этади. Кўп йиллик тайёргарлик
жараёнининг ҳар бир ўқув-машғулот йилидан иккинчисига кўчириш ва ҳар бир
тайёргарлик гуруҳидан иккинчисига ўтказилиши Ю.Д.Железняк [5.] томонидан ишлаб
чиқилган меъёрий талаблар асосида амалга оширилиши одат тусига кирган. Масалан, у
тайёргарлик жараёнининг турли циклларида турли ёшли волейболчиларнинг жисмоний
тайёргарлик даражаси ва уни ўзгариш динамикасини назорат қилишда қуйидаги меъёрий
талаблардан фойдаланишни тавсия этади (1-жадвал).
Таҳлил ва натижалар. Жисмоний тайёргарлик даражасини баҳолашга
мўлжалланган бундай меъёрий талаблар бошқа мутахассислар томонидан ҳам жорий
этилган. Шунинг учун улардан фақат шартли мўлжал сифатида фойдаланиш мумкин.
Қайд этилган муаллифларнинг бир гуруҳи жисмоний сифатларнинг ривожланиш
динамикасини назорат қилиш учун қатор тест машқларидан фойдаланганлар [5].
Уларнинг иккинчи гуруҳи тест машқларини меъёрий мезонлар сифатида қўллаганлар [5].

Бошқа бир гуруҳ муаллифлар диагностик тестларни турли ёшли волейболчиларга
мўлжалланган модель кўрсаткичларни яратиш мақсадида қўллаганлар. Лекин, назорат
учун меъёрий талаблар ва модель кўрсаткичларни ифода этиш мақсадида қўлланилган
диагностик тестлар натижалари бир-биридан кескин фарқ қилиши кузатилади. Эҳтимол
бунинг сабаби меъёрий талаблар ва модель кўрсаткичларни турли йилларда ишлаб
чиқилганлиги билан боғлиқ бўлиши мумкин.
Юқорида таъкидланганидек, кўп йиллик спорт тренировкаси жараёнида
волейболчиларни мусобақаларга тайёрлаш, “спорт формасига” етказиш ва
мусобақаларда юксак натижалар кўрсатиш махсус жисмоний иш қобилияти ҳамда унинг
устувор компонентларига боғлиқдир. Аммо, мазкур масалаларга бағишланган қатор
манбаларда волейболчиларга хос жисмоний иш қобилияти турлича талқин этилади ва
унинг устувор компонентлари тариқасида келтирилган сифатлар бир-бирига мос
келмайди. Чунончи, А.В.Буликина, А.С.Ананьинларнинг [2] эътироф этишича,
296

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

волейболчиларда сакровчанлик, старт реакцияси, муайян оралиқларга югуриш вақти ва
чаққонлик (координацион қобилият) етакчи сифатлар таркибидан жой олиши керак экан.
Ю.П.Денисенко ва бошқалар [4] махсус жисмоний иш қобилиятини тиклаш ва оширишда
миорелаксацион (мушакларни бўшаштириш) чораларини қўллаш ўта фойдали
эканлигини эътироф этадилар. Улар бундай фикрни тезкор ҳаракатлар ёки тезкорликка
бўлган чидамкорлик, координацион қобилиятни намойиш этишда мушаклар фаоллиги
миорелаксациясиз амалга оширилмаслиги билан асослайдилар. Бу борада М.А.Годик [3.]
томонидан эътироф этилган фикр диққатни жалб қилади. Унинг таъкидлашича, ҳар бир
жисмоний сифатни, яъни тезкорлик, чидамкорлик, чаққонлик ёки координацион
қобилият ва эгилувчанликни ҳам, техник-тактик малакаларни ҳам ҳаракатга келтирувчи
манба – бу куч ёки куч сифатлари экан. Агар куч заиф шаклланган бўлса ёки толиқиш
натижасида у тушиб кетган бўлса, спортчида қайд этилган барча сифатлар суръати тушиб
кетар экан.
Волейболда 4- ва 5-партияларда, футболда таймларнинг сўнгги қисмида,
баскетболда 3- ва 4-бўлимларда толиқиш аломатларининг кучайиши биринчи навбатда
куч сифатларини тушиб кетишига олиб келар экан. Шунинг учун муаллиф спорт
ўйинларида куч сифатларини эрта ёшликдан бошлаб ихтисослаштирилган йўналишда
ривожлантиришга устуворлик беришни тавсия этади. Лекин, у бундай куч сифатларини
самарали шакллантириш учун аввало спорт ўйинларига хос энергетикани кучайтирувчи
аэроб имкониятларни ошириш зарурлигига эътибор қаратади.
Бу борада юкламаларни таъсир этиши, ривожлантирилаётган сифат ёки
шакллантирилаётган техник-тактик ҳаракатларнинг ўзлаштирилиш даражаси ва
уларнинг ўзгариш динамикаси мунтазам назорат қилиниб борилиши, олинган натижалар
асосида тайёргарлик дастурларига, машғулот мазмуни, ҳажми ва шиддатига мувофиқ
ўзгартиришлар киритилиб борилиши муҳим аҳамият касб этади. Бундай жараённи
самарали ташкил қилишда “теренр-спортчи-тренер-спортчи-натижа” тизимини илмий
асосда қўллаш жисмоний ва техник-тактик ҳаракатларни мақсадли шакллантириш,
жисмоний иш қобилиятини сайқал топтириш ва юксак "спорт формаси" даражасига
эришишни таъминлаб, спортчиларни рақобатли мусобақаларга мос равишда тайёрлашга
замин яратади.
Мазкур муаммо ва масалалар юқори малакали волейболчилар тайёрлаш тизими
доирасида ҳам кўплаб мутахассис-олимлар томонидан ўрганилган. Жумладан,
Ю.Д.Железняк [5.] ўзининг узоқ йиллар давомида орттирган тренерлик тажрибаси ва
қатор тадқиқотларига асосан шуни таъкидлайдики, юқори малакали волейболчилар
тайёрлаш тизими кўп йилларга мўлжалланган педагогик жараён бўлиб, бир-бирига узвий
боғланган босқичлардан иборат бўлиши керак экан. Биринчи босқич (9-14 ёш) – бу
танлов ва дастлабки тайёргарлик босқичи. Ушбу босқичда болаларга хос бўлган наслий
ва ҳаёт давомида эришган қобилиятлари, бўлажак антропометрик кўрсаткичларини
эътиборга олган ҳолда волейбол амалиётида жорий этилган услуб ва тестлар ёрдамида
297

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

танлов ўтказиш, кейинчалик танланган болалар билан бошланғич тайёргарлик
жараёнини махсус дастур доирасида ташкил қилиш. Муаллифнинг фикрига асосан бу
босқичда асосан соғлиқни мустаҳкамлаш, ҳаётий зарур ҳаракат малакаларига ўргатиш,
асосий жисмоний сифатларни пропорционал йўналишда ривожлантириш устувор
аҳамият касб этади.
Иккинчи босқичда (15-17 ёш) ўқув машғулотлари махсус тайёргарликка
қаратилиши, яъни волейболга хос бўлган жисмоний сифатларни шакллантириш билан
бир қаторда техник-тактик маҳоратни ўйин функцияларига (амплуа) мўлжаллаштириш
доирасида такомиллаштиришга устунлик бериш тавсия этилади.
Учинчи босқич (18-20 ёш) жисмоний-функционал имкониятлар ва техник-тактик
маҳоратни ҳартомонламалик (универсализация) принципига асосланган ҳолда
такомиллаштиришга қаратилиши эътироф этилган.
Тўртинчи босқич ва ундан кейинги даврлар (21 ва ундан катта ёш) ичида
машғулотлар – олий спорт маҳоратини шакллантиришга қаратилади.
Шу билан бир қаторда шуни ҳам таъкидлаш жоизки, спорт ўйинларининг ҳар бир
турида у ёки бу жисмоний сифатларни шакллантириш устунлиги йиллик тайёргарлик
жараёнининг турли циклларида турлича бўлиши бир қатор тадқиқотлардан маълумдир.
В.Ю.Зубковнинг (2000) фикрига қараганда, юқори малакали волейболчиларда
тайёргарлик даврининг биринчи босқичида жисмоний иш қобилиятининг куч сифатлари,
тезкорликка бўлган чидамкорлик, чаққонлик, иккинчи босқичида – тезкорлик-куч,
сакровчанлик, сакраш чидамкорлиги ҳамда координацион қобилият каби
компонентларини шакллантириш устуворлиги таъминланиши мақсадга мувофиқ экан.
Тайёргарлик даврининг мусобақа босқичларида қайд этилган жисмоний сифатлар
мувофиқ тартибда шакллантирилиб борилиши лозим экан. Бошқа бир қатор мутахассисолимлар тайёргарлик жараёнининг дастлабки уч босқичида (УЖТ, МЖТ, МОТ)
жисмоний иш қобилиятининг тезкорлик-куч сифатлари, уларнинг чидамкорлиги, шу
жумладан тезкорлик, чаққонлик, эгилувчанлик, сакровчанлик ва сакраш чидамкорлиги
каби компонентларини сайқал топтиришга устунлик беришни, мусобақа циклларида эса
ушбу сифатларни янада ихтисослаштириш асосида ўйин усулларини шакллантириш ва
ўйин чидамкорлигини ривожлантириш зарурлигини таъкидлайдилар.[6]
Бу борада жисмоний тайёргарлик бўйича етакчи ва тажрибали тренер италиялик
Д.Аззара томонидан эътироф этилган фикр диққатга лойиқдир. Унинг таъкидлашича,
волейболда ижро этиладиган деярли барча ҳаракатлар (сакраш, югуриш, ҳужум
зарбалари ва ҳ.к.) портловчи, динамик, реактив, максимал куч турлари асосида амалга
оширилади. Шунинг учун у тайёргарлик жараёнининг барча босқичларида ушбу куч
турларини ихтисослаштирилган функционал машқлар ёрдамида шакллантириб бориш
муҳим аҳамиятга эга экан. Лекин бундай машқларни тайёргарлик циклларининг мақсад
ва вазифалари доирасида сайқал топтириш зарурлиги эътироф этилади.
298

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Алоҳида шунга урғу бериш жоизки, барча спорт ўйинларида, шу жумладан
волейболда ҳам, жисмоний иш қобилияти ёки жисмоний сифатларни ривожлантиришда
қўлланиладиган машқлар ҳар бир техник-тактик усуллар координациясига
ихтисослаштирилган бўлиши устувор аҳамият касб этади.
Юқорида қайд этилган маълумотлар ва фикр-мулоҳазалар таҳлилидан kelib chiqgan
holda qo’yidagicha xulosaga keldik: ёш волейболчиларни тайёрлаш, айниқса профессионал
волейбол “остонасида” турган 15-16 ёшли волейболчилар билан машғулот ўтказиш,
уларнинг жисмоний ва функционал имкониятлари, бошқача қилиб айтганда умумий ва
махсус жисмоний иш қобилиятини шакллантиришда йиллик тайёргарлик циклларининг
ўзига хос хусусиятларига риоя қилишни талаб қилади. Бу борада шуғулланувчи
болаларда объектив натижалар берувчи тестлар ўтказиш орқали уларнинг реал
имкониятларини билиш ва машқларни қўллашда ана шу имкониятларга асосланиш олиб
борилаётган педагогик жараённинг самарадорлигини таъминлайди.
Хулоса. Волейболга хос махсус жисмоний иш қобилиятининг таркибий
компонентларини ташкил этувчи сакровчанлик, сакраш чидамкорлиги, тезкорлик-куч,
чаққонлик (координацион қобилият), чидамкорлик, ҳатто эгилувчанлик сифатларини
ҳам йиллик тайёргарлик жараёнининг ҳар бир циклида мувофиқ машқлар ёрдамида
мақсадли шакллантириб бориш спорт формасига эришишда устувор аҳамият касб этади.
Лекин, муаллифлар томонидан қайд этилган фикр-мулоҳазалардан маълум бўлдики,
ушбу жисмоний сифатларни ривожлантиришда қўлланиладиган машқлар мазмуни
волейболчининг майдон бўйлаб (зоналар бўйлаб) ҳаракатланиши, ижро этиладиган
техник-тактик усуллар (ҳужум зарбалари, тўсиқ қўйиш ва ҳ.к.) координациясига мос
келмаслик ҳолатлари кузатилар экан.

The recent decrees and resolutions aimed at promoting physical education and sports in
our republic mark significant steps toward developing the physical culture movement,
revitalizing traditional folk games, fostering a healthy lifestyle, and training talented athletes to
enhance their skills in modern sports. These initiatives play a crucial role in advancing the sports
sector within our country.
Engagement in physical education and sports is essential for comprehensive physical
development, strengthening the human body, and improving physiological functions and overall
health.
Our nation is undergoing extensive reforms designed to shape the prospects for socioeconomic and cultural development, with the aim of establishing a prominent position in the
global community. These fundamental reforms span all areas of social life, taking into account
local conditions, economic capabilities, and intellectual resources, while also learning from the
experiences of developed countries.
Despite the positive outcomes of international cooperation across various fields, the
pursuit of national independence and the enhancement of our achievements require unwavering
commitment, enthusiasm, and determination from all members of society to address existing
challenges effectively.
The continuous development and implementation of new techniques during training are
essential for success in sports for several reasons [1, 4].
Human physiology is a dynamic field where new discoveries continually emerge,
enhancing our understanding of how the body responds to various types of stress, recovers, and
adapts to changing conditions. Integrating this evolving knowledge into training regimens
allows for optimization, making workouts more effective and safer.
Another significant factor is technological advancement. Modern technologies, such as
wearable devices for monitoring physical conditions, analytical software, and augmented reality
(AR) applications, are revolutionizing the analysis and adjustment of training processes. These
tools enable the collection and examination of vast amounts of data on athletes' health and
performance, facilitating more individualized and adaptable training programs.
Furthermore, the development of sports sciences is crucial. Sports are evolving, with new
disciplines emerging and existing rules changing, necessitating that athletes and coaches adopt
innovative methods and approaches to training.

In the context of renewal in Uzbekistan, there is a strong emphasis on advancing physical
education and sports. Engaging all segments of the population, particularly the youth, in regular
physical activity and mass sports is a priority. Promoting the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and
fully utilizing the physical education, health, and sports infrastructure established in the country
are central to our state policy.
Achieving high standards in physical education and improving the quality of life for the
population are strategic goals that are integral to the sustainable development of the nation.
Additionally, enhancing the level of computerization in the educational and training processes
in physical education and sports, while incorporating modern information technologies and
multimedia products, remains a pressing issue [2, 81].
The purpose of this article is to highlight innovative approaches and methods in sports
training that significantly enhance athletes' physical fitness and performance while
demonstrating the potential to transform the future of sports training. We aim to provide an
overview of advanced innovations integrated into the training process, elucidate their
underlying principles, advantages, and impacts on sports practice, and address scientific and
pedagogical issues related to the use of modern information and communication technologies
(ICT) in sports. Additionally, we will explore contemporary and promising objectives in
advanced training courses and develop pedagogical tools for effectively utilizing ICT in
education.
In the context of retraining and advanced training for physical education and sports
specialists, it is essential to teach participants not only to observe and interpret information
displayed on screens but also to engage creatively in this process. Connecting the hidden
possibilities offered by the didactic properties of education with modern ICT represents a
contemporary and promising goal in advanced education.
We define the didactic function as the manifestation of the external properties of
educational tools used for specific purposes within the educational process. This encompasses
their usage functions, roles, and significance. Examining the development of educational
processes reveals the critical pedagogical issues that can be addressed through the application
of ICT. From our experience in various educational domains, it is evident that information
technologies create numerous positive opportunities, enhancing learning and teaching outcomes
[3, 31].
As we know, information and communication technologies (ICT) in education involve
the preparation and transmission of information to learners through computer equipment and
software. This process comprises two essential components: technical means (such as computer
hardware and communication devices) and software tools designed for various educational
purposes.
For teachers to effectively integrate modern ICT into lesson preparation and delivery, it
is crucial for them to be well-acquainted with the functional capabilities and usage conditions
of these components. Both technical and software tools possess unique characteristics that
302

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

significantly influence the learning process. Therefore, it is important to understand the rationale
behind using ICT in educational settings and the methodological issues they address.
In today’s educational landscape, sports educators, trainers, and physical education
instructors are increasingly required to utilize computer programs that facilitate highly effective,
professionally oriented training. This approach leverages modern information technologies to
enhance the educational experience in physical education.
In the context of using ICT in education, specialized software tools are essential. These
tools are specifically designed to support the educational process by facilitating the study of a
subject area, providing the technology necessary for this study, and enabling various educational
activities related to the subject. Such software tools, which enhance the functionality of different
educational processes, are known as pedagogical software tools. Currently, there is a wide
variety of pedagogical software tools available, each tailored to meet specific educational needs
and objectives [5, 74].
Today, knowledge obtained with the help of modern information and communication
technologies remains in memory for a long time and can be restored by repeating it in a short
time for later use in practice. In this case, information awareness and effective use of
information in work activities depend on the following.
First, a modern sports specialist must know how to receive, process and use information
using computers, telecommunications and other means of information in order to freely navigate
in information flows.
Second, ensuring the necessary level of information literacy of a specialist should not be
the goal of only one academic discipline.
Third, modern information technologies should be applied to all academic disciplines,
and this requires a certain professional training, familiarity with the possibilities of information
technologies, and the ability to use these opportunities in their scientific and practical activities.
This situation is very relevant and pedagogically significant, because in the process of training,
they experience the possibilities and advantages of modern information technologies on
themselves [6,24].
Innovative approaches to sports training are unlocking new possibilities for coaches and
athletes, providing methods and technologies that significantly enhance the effectiveness of
training, accelerate recovery from injuries, and promote safer, more individualized experiences.
The incorporation of virtual and augmented reality, kinetic technologies, biomechanical
analysis, and personalized nutrition and physiological monitoring systems equips sports
professionals with powerful tools.
Successful implementation of these innovative methods requires a deep understanding of
both the theoretical foundations of the training process and the practical aspects of their
application in sports. This highlights the need for continuous education and the exchange of
expertise among specialists across various disciplines—from athletes and coaches to scientists
and technology developers.
303

The significance of innovative approaches in athlete development is undeniable. They
create new opportunities to improve the efficiency and safety of the training process. However,
their effective application necessitates a thoughtful integration with traditional methods and a
personalized approach for each athlete. Moving forward, we can anticipate further integration
of emerging technologies into sports science, making training processes even more efficient,
safe, and tailored to the unique needs of each athlete.
Another important aspect of using information and communication technologies in the
teaching process is the ability to monitor student progress through various educational and
pedagogical programs, which greatly facilitates the assessment of knowledge. Physical
education teachers, like their counterparts in other subjects, can effectively utilize video lessons
to enhance learning outcomes. By engaging with the theoretical components of a lesson,
students can deepen their understanding of the material.
Research indicates that animation and modeling significantly enhance conceptual
comprehension, particularly regarding complex ideas like molecular movement. In physical
education, the use of modern multimedia tools to demonstrate motor movement processes helps
students retain information and enables them to perform tasks independently. This combination
of theory and practical demonstration reinforces learning and fosters greater skill acquisition.

Kirish. Kinematografiya – bu tasvir va tovushning uyg‘unligi orqali tomoshabinlarga
estetik va emosional ta’sir ko‘rsatish san’ati. Kino asarining samarali vizual ta’siri nafaqat kadr
kompozitsiyasiga, balki musiqa va ritmga ham bevosita bog‘liq. Vizual kompozitsiya kadr
tuzilishi, yorug‘lik, rang va geometrik elementlar orqali ma’no va hissiyot yetkazsa, musiqiy
ritm esa film dinamikasi va atmosferasini shakllantirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi [8, 34-39].
Ushbu maqolada kinematografiyada vizual kompozitsiya va musiqiy ritm uyg‘unligining estetik
va psixologik ta’siri tahlil qilinadi. Film yaratish jarayonida tasvir va tovush uyg‘unligi qanday
shakllantirilishi, u tomoshabinning hissiyotlariga qanday ta’sir ko‘rsatishi va zamonaviy
texnologiyalar bu jarayonga qanday o‘zgarishlar kiritayotgani masalalari yoritiladi. Mavzuning
dolzarbligi shundaki, kino san’ati rivojlanib borar ekan, vizual va musiqiy elementlarning
uyg‘unligi yanada murakkab va ijodiy usullar bilan boyitilmoqda.
Kino san’ati – bu nafaqat hikoya qilish vositasi, balki tomoshabin qalbiga bevosita ta’sir
o‘tkazadigan vizual va audio elementlarning uyg‘unlashuvi natijasida shakllanadigan murakkab
san’at turidir. Har bir kino asarining muvaffaqiyati uning vizual kompozitsiyasi va badiiy
ifodaviyligiga bog‘liq. Rejissyor va operatorlar har bir kadrni maxsus tuzib, tomoshabinga
kerakli his-tuyg‘ularni yetkazishga harakat qilishadi. Shunday qilib, vizual kompozitsiya – bu
kinematografiyaning estetik asosini tashkil etuvchi eng muhim elementlardan biri hisoblanadi.
Vizual kompozitsiya, eng avvalo, tasvir ichidagi obyektlarning joylashuvi va ularning o‘zaro
nisbatlariga bog‘liq. Kadr tarkibida qahramonning qaysi joyda joylashgani, uning orqa fon bilan
qanday uyg‘unlashgani yoki qaysi burchakdan tasvirlangani tomoshabin ongida turli xil
assotsiatsiyalar hosil qiladi [7, 87-99]. Masalan, Mark Bergman va Stenli Kubrik kabi mashhur
rejissyorlarning filmlarida simmetrik kompozitsiyalar va puxta ishlangan rakurslar
tomoshabinga maxsus estetik tajriba beradi. Kubrikning mashhur "Shining" filmidagi uzoq
koridorlar va markaziy joylashgan qahramonlar tomoshabinga qo‘rquv va bezovtalik hissini
uyg‘otadi. Vizual kompozitsiyaning muhim jihatlaridan yana biri bu – yorug‘lik va rang. Har
306

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

bir filmning o‘ziga xos rang palitrasi bo‘lib, u muayyan kayfiyatni ifodalaydi. Masalan, Wes
Anderson filmlarida iliq pastel ranglar ishlatilishi tomoshabinda osoyishtalik va nostalgiya
hissini uyg‘otsa, Christopher Nolan filmlaridagi sovuq va monoxrom rang sxemalari
voqealarning jiddiy va sirli ekanligini anglatadi. Yorug‘lik esa film estetikasida hal qiluvchi rol
o‘ynaydi – yorqin yoki soyalarga boy kadrlar orqali film muhitiga mos dramatik ta’sir yaratiladi.
Kino san’atida harakat va chuqurlik ham kompozitsiyaning ajralmas qismi hisoblanadi. Ayrim
filmlar statik kadrlarni afzal ko‘rsa, boshqalari harakat orqali voqealarni yetkazib berishga
intiladi. Masalan, Alfonso Cuarónning "Roma" filmida uzoq davom etuvchi sahnalar va
harakatli kamera yordamida hayotning tabiiy oqimi tomoshabinga yetkaziladi. Shu bilan birga,
Quentin Tarantino filmlarida kamera harakati dinamik bo‘lib, tomoshabinni voqealar ichiga
tortadi. Vizual kompozitsiya nafaqat estetik vosita, balki hikoya qilishning muhim usuli hamdir.
Kadr ichidagi tafsilotlar, ob’ektlarning joylashuvi va ranglarning uyg‘unligi orqali film
tomoshabinga sezilarli darajada chuqur ta’sir o‘tkazishi mumkin. Shunday ekan,
kinematografiyada vizual kompozitsiyani anglash va undan samarali foydalanish kino san’ati
taraqqiyotida muhim o‘rin egallaydi.
Kino – bu nafaqat tasvirlar ketma-ketligi, balki ularning hissiy ta’sirini kuchaytiruvchi
musiqiy ritm bilan uyg‘unlashgan san’at turidir. Musiqa kinoda bevosita hikoya qilish vositasi
sifatida ishlatiladi va filmning umumiy kayfiyatini, dramatik kuchini hamda tomoshabinning
hissiy tajribasini shakllantirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Musiqaning ritmi filmning vizual oqimi
bilan birlashganda, tomoshabin ongida kuchli taassurot qoldiradi va filmning ta’sirchanligini
oshiradi. Musiqiy ritm asosan temp (tezlik) va taktlarga asoslanadi. Filmda ritm vizual harakat
bilan uyg‘unlashib, dramatik kuchayish yoki pasayishni ta’minlaydi. Masalan, hayajonli
sahnalarda tez ritmli musiqa ishlatilsa, tasvir ham shunga mos ravishda tez-tez almashib,
dinamik harakat paydo bo‘ladi. Aksincha, tinch va lirik sahnalarda sekin va cho‘zilgan ritm
filmga chuqurlik hamda falsafiy ohang bag‘ishlaydi. Kino tarixida musiqiy ritmning turli xil
yondashuvlari kuzatiladi. Masalan, Alfred Hitchcock filmlarida musiqiy ritm psixologik
keskinlikni oshirish uchun ishlatilgan. Uning "Psycho" filmidagi violonchel bilan chalinadigan
keskin ritmik ohang, xususan, mashhur dush sahnasida, tomoshabinning qo‘rquvini
kuchaytirishga xizmat qiladi. Stanley Kubrickning "2001: A Space Odyssey" filmida esa klassik
musiqaning sekin va og‘ir ritmi vizual tasvirning ulug‘vorligini ta’kidlash uchun ishlatilgan.
Musiqiy ritm faqat instrumental ohang bilan chegaralanmaydi, balki tovush effektlari va
dialoglar bilan ham uyg‘unlashib boradi [3, 255-258]. Masalan, Christopher Nolan filmlarida
(ayniqsa, "Dunkirk") musiqa va tovush dizayni o‘ziga xos ritmik struktura yaratib, voqealarning
dinamikasini belgilaydi. Hans Zimmerning bu film uchun yaratgan saundtreki filmning
keskinligini oshirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Shuningdek, musiqiy ritm filmlarda vizual montaj
bilan chambarchas bog‘liq. Quentin Tarantino filmlarida musiqiy ritm va montaj uyg‘unligi
orqali xarakterlarning kayfiyatini ifodalash kuzatiladi. Masalan, "Pulp Fiction" filmida musiqiy
ritm harakatlar bilan mos ravishda kesilgan bo‘lib, sahnalarning jonli va ta’sirchan bo‘lishiga
xizmat qiladi. Umuman olganda, kinoda musiqiy ritm nafaqat eshitish orqali, balki his qilish
307

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

orqali ham tasvirlanadi. U filmni vizual kompozitsiya bilan bog‘lab, tomoshabinning hissiy
tajribasini chuqurlashtiradi. Shu boisdan, film yaratuvchilari musiqiy ritmni nafaqat fon element
sifatida, balki muhim badiiy vosita sifatida ko‘rib, undan samarali foydalanish orqali o‘z
filmlarining ta’sirini oshirishga harakat qilishadi [2, 58].
Kinematografiya san’atida tasvir va musiqa o‘zaro uyg‘unlashgan holda ishlatilganda,
film tomoshabinga yanada chuqurroq ta’sir o‘tkaza oladi. Vizual kompozitsiya va musiqiy
ritmning bir-biriga mos kelishi filmning estetik go‘zalligini oshirish bilan birga,
tomoshabinning psixologik tajribasini ham shakllantiradi. Bu uyg‘unlik nafaqat filmning
umumiy kayfiyatini belgilaydi, balki tomoshabin his-tuyg‘ularini boshqarish va kuchaytirishda
ham muhim rol o‘ynaydi [5, 192-202].
Vizual kompozitsiya va musiqiy ritm uyg‘unligi kino san’atining eng muhim estetik
tamoyillaridan biridir. Har bir filmning o‘ziga xos uslubi, rang gammasi, yorug‘lik va tasvir
kompozitsiyasi musiqa bilan uyg‘unlashganda, film san’at asariga aylanadi. Masalan, Terrence
Malickning "The Tree of Life" filmida tasvir va musiqaning uyg‘unligi orqali hayotning
ulug‘vorligi va falsafiy mazmuni tomoshabinga yetkaziladi. Shu bilan birga, tarkib va ritm
uyg‘unligi filmlarning hissiyot uyg‘otuvchi kuchini oshiradi. Musiqaning ritmik strukturasiga
qarab, vizual montaj ham turli xil usullarda amalga oshirilishi mumkin. Masalan, Sergey
Eyzenshteynning "Battleship Potemkin" filmida musiqiy ritm tasvirlar ketma-ketligining
tezligiga moslashtirilgan bo‘lib, bu filmning estetik ta’sirini kuchaytirgan. Zamonaviy kinoda
esa, masalan, Damien Chazelle'ning "La La Land" filmida musiqiy ritm va vizual harakat
uyg‘unligi orqali klassik musiqa va zamonaviy estetika birlashtirilgan [1, 193-195].
Vizual kompozitsiya va musiqiy ritm uyg‘unligi tomoshabinning ruhiy holatiga bevosita
ta’sir qiladi. Yaxshi tanlangan musiqa va to‘g‘ri joylashtirilgan tasvirlar tomoshabinni
xotirjamlik, hayajon, quvonch yoki qo‘rquv kabi turli holatlarga olib kelishi mumkin. Masalan,
Christopher Nolan filmlarida Hans Zimmer bastalagan musiqaning takroriy ritmlari va
filmlardagi chuqur simmetrik kompozitsiyalar stress va keskinlik hissini oshirish uchun
ishlatiladi. Shuningdek, musiqiy ritmning tezligi va ovoz balandligi tomoshabinning yurak urish
tezligiga ham ta’sir ko‘rsatishi mumkin. Masalan, qo‘rqinchli filmlarda birdaniga paydo
bo‘ladigan keskin musiqalar (jump scare) vizual kompozitsiyaning qorong‘i va sirli atmosferasi
bilan uyg‘unlashganda, tomoshabinda stress va qo‘rquv hissini oshiradi. Aksincha,
melodramatik filmlarda sekin va sokin musiqiy ritm chuqur hissiyotlar uyg‘otishga xizmat
qiladi. Ushbu uyg‘unlikning eng yorqin namunalari orasida Quentin Tarantino filmlarini ham
keltirish mumkin. U filmlarida g‘ayrioddiy va ba’zan hatto kutilmagan musiqiy tanlov orqali
vizual tasvirlar bilan paradoksal uyg‘unlik hosil qiladi. Masalan, "Kill Bill" filmidagi jang
sahnasida dinamik harakat sekin ritmli musiqa bilan uyg‘unlashib, tomoshabinda o‘ziga xos
estetik zavq uyg‘otadi. Vizual kompozitsiya va musiqiy ritmning uyg‘unligi kino san’atining
ajralmas qismi bo‘lib, u nafaqat filmning go‘zalligini oshiradi, balki tomoshabinning psixologik
tajribasini ham boshqaradi. Rejissyorlar ushbu elementlardan samarali foydalanib, tomoshabin
ongiga chuqur ta’sir o‘tkazuvchi kinematik asarlar yaratadilar. Kino san’ati rivojlangan sari,

vizual va musiqa uyg‘unligi yanada murakkab va ta’sirchan usullar bilan qo‘llanilmoqda, bu
esa kino tomoshabin uchun nafaqat hikoya, balki his-tuyg‘ular dunyosiga aylanishini
ta’minlaydi [4, 63].
Kinematografiya san’ati doimiy ravishda rivojlanib, zamonaviy texnologiyalar
yordamida yanada mukammal shaklga ega bo‘lmoqda. Xususan, audio-vizual uyg‘unlikni
ta’minlashda innovatsion texnologiyalarning o‘rni beqiyosdir. Bugungi kunda sun’iy intellekt,
virtual haqiqat (VR), kengaytirilgan haqiqat (AR), Dolby Atmos kabi ilg‘or audio tizimlari va
kompyuter grafikasi (CGI) orqali filmlarda musiqa va tasvirning ideal uyg‘unligi yaratilmoqda.
Ushbu texnologiyalar film estetikasini yanada boyitish bilan birga, tomoshabinning histuyg‘ulariga yanada chuqurroq ta’sir o‘tkazishga xizmat qiladi [6, 313-324].
Zamonaviy kinoda sun’iy intellekt algoritmlari musiqiy ritm va tasvirni
sinxronlashtirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi. AI yordamida filmning muayyan sahnalari uchun eng
mos musiqa tanlanadi va u tasvirlar bilan mutanosib tarzda uyg‘unlashtiriladi. Masalan, Netflix
va Hollywood studiyalarida AI asosida musiqa yaratish texnologiyalari sinovdan
o‘tkazilmoqda, bu esa filmlarning ovoz dizayni va musiqiy bezaklarini avtomatlashtirishga
yordam beradi. Bundan tashqari, sun’iy intellekt yordamida montaj jarayoni tezlashmoqda.
Masalan, Adobe Premiere Pro va DaVinci Resolve kabi dasturlar AI yordamida tasvir va musiqa
ritmini moslashtirish imkoniyatiga ega. Bu esa rejissyorlarga va montaj ustalariga ancha
qulaylik yaratadi.
Dolby Atmos kabi ilg‘or ovoz tizimlari filmda realistik va ko‘p o‘lchamli audio tajribani
yaratishga yordam beradi. Oddiy stereo yoki 5.1 ovoz tizimlariga qaraganda, Dolby Atmos
filmlarning ovoz dizayniga uch o‘lchamli chuqurlik qo‘shib, tomoshabinga yanada ta’sirchan
tajriba taqdim etadi. Ushbu texnologiya yordamida film ichidagi ovoz harakatlanadi, masalan,
tomoshabin boshidan yuqoridan uchib o‘tayotgan samolyot yoki xonaning har xil burchaklarida
eshitiladigan tovushlar haqiqiylikni oshiradi. Bu texnologiya Christopher Nolanning “Tenet”
va “Dunkirk” filmlarida muvaffaqiyatli qo‘llangan bo‘lib, unda musiqa va tovush effektlari
vizual harakatlarga sinxronlashtirilgan. Hans Zimmerning yaratgan saundtreklari aynan ushbu
texnologiya orqali filmlarning dramatik kuchini oshirishga xizmat qiladi.
Bugungi filmlarda CGI texnologiyalaridan keng foydalanish vizual kompozitsiyani
yanada takomillashtirish imkonini bermoqda. Ayniqsa, ilmiy-fantastik janrdagi filmlar
(masalan, Avatar, Dune, The Avengers) audio-vizual uyg‘unlikni mukammallashtirishda CGI
texnologiyalariga tayanadi. CGI orqali yaratilgan tasvirlar odatda maxsus ovoz effektlari va
musiqa bilan uyg‘unlashtiriladi. Masalan, Marvel filmlarida vizual sahnalarning epik ohangini
oshirish uchun simfonik orkestr va elektron musiqa uyg‘unligi ishlatiladi. Bu esa film
atmosferasini yanada kuchaytiradi.
VR va AR texnologiyalari ham kino san’atida audio-vizual uyg‘unlikni yaratishda
inqilobiy yondashuvlarni taqdim etmoqda. VR filmlar tomoshabinni to‘liq immersiv muhitga
olib kirib, musiqa va tasvirning bir-biri bilan uyg‘unlashgan holda namoyon bo‘lishini
ta’minlaydi. Masalan, Google Spotlight Stories tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan interaktiv filmlar
309

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

VR texnologiyasi orqali tomoshabinni hikoya ichiga kiritadi. Bu yerda ovoz va tasvir bir
vaqtning o‘zida o‘zgarib, tomoshabinning qarash yo‘nalishiga mos ravishda moslashadi. Shu
tariqa, musiqa va vizual kompozitsiya interaktiv tajribaga aylanadi. Zamonaviy texnologiyalar
kino san’atida audio-vizual uyg‘unlikni yangi bosqichga olib chiqmoqda. Sun’iy intellekt,
Dolby Atmos, CGI, VR va AR kabi texnologiyalar tasvir va musiqa o‘rtasidagi mutanosiblikni
oshirib, filmlarning estetik va psixologik ta’sirini kuchaytiradi. Kinematografiya bunday
texnologiyalar yordamida rivojlanib borayotgan sari, audio-vizual uyg‘unlikni yaratish jarayoni
yanada takomillashmoqda va tomoshabinlarga mislsiz hissiy tajriba taqdim etmoqda.
Xulosa. Kinematografiyada vizual kompozitsiya va musiqiy ritm uyg‘unligi filmning
estetik va emotsional ta’sirini oshirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Ushbu uyg‘unlik tomoshabinni
filmga yanada chuqurroq jalb etish, uning hissiy tajribasini boyitish va vizual hikoyaning
kuchini oshirish imkonini beradi. Zamonaviy texnologiyalar, xususan, sun’iy intellekt, Dolby
Atmos, CGI, VR va AR kabi innovatsion vositalar kino san’atida audio-vizual uyg‘unlikni
yangi bosqichga olib chiqmoqda. Sun’iy intellekt musiqiy ritm va tasvir sinxronizatsiyasini
avtomatlashtirishga yordam bersa, ilg‘or audio tizimlari ovoz muhitini yanada realistik va
chuqurroq qilishga xizmat qiladi. CGI texnologiyalari esa vizual kompozitsiyani
takomillashtirib, musiqa bilan uyg‘un holda dramatik effektlarni kuchaytiradi. Kelajakda
kinematografiyada texnologik innovatsiyalarning rivojlanishi vizual va audio elementlar
uyg‘unligini yanada mukammallashtirishga yo‘l ochadi. Shunday ekan, rejissyorlar va
musiqachilar bunday vositalardan samarali foydalanib, tomoshabinni hayratga soladigan filmlar
yaratishda davom etadilar. Shu bilan birga, musiqa va tasvirning mosligi nafaqat texnik jarayon,
balki san’atning o‘ziga xos ijodiy ifodasi bo‘lib qoladi.

conditions. It is for these reasons that it is necessary to systematically inform students about
these factors. Timely warning and prevention of the above-mentioned problems will greatly
simplify the vocalist's tasks and serve the longevity of his singing voice.
This article describes the causes of diseases of the vocal apparatus, provides examples of
their warnings and prevention, and analyzes the methods of prevention of the above problems.
Keywords: Vocal apparatus, vocal cords, psycho-physiology, larynx, vocal hygiene,
theoretical analysis, practical experience, voice diagnostics, ecology, external factors.
Теоретический анализ
В рамках теоретического анализа были изучены различные источники из
вокальной педагогики, гигиены голоса и фониатрии. Это включало в себя обзор научных
трудов и методических пособий по вокальному искусству, таких как работы Н. И.
Тихонова («Фониатрия и вокальная терапия»), Г. Р. Давидсона («Основы вокальной
педагогики») и Ф. М. Шмидта («Гигиена голоса и фонопедия»). Эти источники
предоставляют глубокое понимание теоретических аспектов голосового аппарата, его
функционирования и профилактики заболеваний, возникающих у вокалистов. Было
также изучено влияние различных экологических факторов (например, загрязнение
воздуха, климатические условия) на состояние голосовых связок, что является важной
темой в контексте профессионального вокала.
Дополнительно рассматривались современные исследования в области
нейробиологии, как нейрофизиология вокального аппарата, изучение взаимодействия
психоэмоциональных состояний с качеством звука. Одним из ярких примеров является
работа Т. Ф. Кондратовой («Нейробиология вокальной техники»), где анализируется
влияние стресса и нервозности на артикуляцию и голосовой поток.
Практический опыт.
Практический опыт был получен через проведение интервью и дискуссий с
педагогами и студентами вокальных факультетов, а также с профессиональными
певцами. В ходе этих разговоров обсуждались основные проблемы, с которыми
сталкиваются вокалисты в процессе обучения и исполнения, а также пути их
преодоления. Например, большинство педагогов отметили значимость правильной
вокальной разминки перед каждым занятием, а также необходимость регулярных
перерывов во время долгих репетиций. Студенты, в свою очередь, поделились опытом о
том, как регулярное использование техники расслабления и дыхательных упражнений
помогает им избегать перенапряжения голосовых связок.
Также были проведены мастер-классы с известными преподавателями, такими как
Петр Станиславович Кожевников, где обсуждались актуальные вопросы развития
голосового аппарата и профилактики заболеваний у студентов вокальных учебных
заведений. Применение методик, таких как «дыхание по Штельцеру» или «методика

упражнения для связок Грейнджера», позволило нам на практике наблюдать улучшение
звучания и улучшение здоровья голосового аппарата у начинающих вокалистов.
Наблюдение.
Наблюдение за состоянием голосового аппарата было проведено в ходе
регулярных занятий по вокалу. Особое внимание было уделено вокалистам с разной
степенью подготовки и продолжительностью практики. Для более точного анализа были
использованы видеозаписи и аудиофайлы занятий, которые позволили зафиксировать
изменения в голосовой технике и выявить особенности голосового аппарата у разных
участников. В процессе наблюдения мы изучали, как влияют различные методы
тренировки на состояние голосовых связок, а также фиксировали признаки усталости и
перенапряжения, возникающие в процессе выполнения сложных вокальных упражнений.
В частности, были отмечены случаи, когда недостаточная расслабленность мышц шеи и
плеч приводила к преждевременному утомлению голоса и снижению качества звучания.
Диагностические методы.
Для диагностики состояния голосового аппарата были использованы медицинские
материалы, включая научные статьи по заболеваниям голосовых связок, а также
клинические исследования, проводимые в специализированных медицинских
учреждениях. Исследования фониатров и лор-врачей, такие как работы А. В. Пантелеева
(«Современные методы диагностики заболеваний голосового аппарата») и Ю. М.
Сучкова («Лечение и профилактика заболеваний голосовых связок»), стали основой для
углубленного анализа возможных заболеваний у вокалистов. Это включало в себя
данные о частых заболеваниях голосового аппарата у профессиональных певцов, таких
как узелки на голосовых связках, полипы, а также хронические воспалительные
процессы. В рамках исследования была использована диагностика с помощью
эндоскопии и видео-ларингостробоскопии для оценки состояния голосовых связок у
участников эксперимента.
Кроме того, была проведена сравнительная диагностика состояния голосового
аппарата до и после применения вокальных упражнений, направленных на улучшение
гибкости и силы голосовых связок. Это позволило выявить ключевые аспекты, влияющие
на возникновение заболеваний, такие как недостаточная техника дыхания или нарушение
вокальной осанки. Важным элементом исследования стала работа с фониатрами, которые
проводили медицинские осмотры и предоставляли рекомендации по коррекции
нарушений.
Таким образом, методы, использованные в этом исследовании, обеспечили
комплексный подход к изучению состояния голосового аппарата у вокалистов и
выявлению возможных путей оптимизации вокальной педагогики для предотвращения
заболеваний и улучшения профессиональной деятельности.

Результаты и обсуждения
Основные причины заболеваний голосового аппарата:
Неправильная вокальная техника.
Неправильная вокальная техника является одной из самых распространённых
причин заболеваний голосового аппарата среди профессиональных певцов и вокалистов.
Ошибки в технике могут включать пение с зажатой гортанью, что приводит к
перенапряжению голосовых связок. Например, если певец не использует правильную
поддержку дыхания и полагается только на напряжение горла, это может вызвать
хронические воспаления, отёки и даже образование узелков на голосовых связках.
Существует также проблема "фальшивого дыхания", когда вокалист не использует
диафрагму для дыхания, что ведет к ухудшению контроля над голосом и излишней
нагрузке на связки.
В работах известных вокальных педагогов, таких как Г. Р. Давидсон в книге
«Основы вокальной педагогики», подчеркивается важность правильной техники
дыхания и использования силы диафрагмы для предотвращения заболеваний.
Пренебрежение этим аспектом может привести к хроническому напряжению в горле и
долгосрочным проблемам с голосом.
Чрезмерная эксплуатация и утомление голоса
Чрезмерное использование голосовых связок без должного отдыха — ещё одна
частая причина заболеваний у профессиональных певцов. Это может включать манеру
315

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

петь слишком широко или на высоких тонах, что приводит к перенапряжению и
усталости. Также вокалисты, которые проводят долгие репетиции без достаточных
перерывов, рискуют вызвать воспалительные процессы в голосовых связках.
Долгое нахождение в шумной среде или разговоры на повышенных тонах —
типичная проблема для людей, которые много общаются или выступают публично.
Исследования показывают, что постоянное перенапряжение голосовых связок может
привести к развитию таких заболеваний, как ларингит или даже полипы на голосовых
связках. В медицинской литературе часто упоминается о высоком уровне заболеваемости
среди учителей, ведущих репортажи или работников сферы обслуживания, где требуется
длительная речь на высоких тонах.
Экологические и внешние факторы.
Загрязнение воздуха, сухой климат, табачный дым, аллергия и холодная погода —
все эти факторы значительно влияют на здоровье голосового аппарата. Загрязнённый
воздух может вызывать воспаление слизистой оболочки гортани и трахеи, что приводит
к повышенной утомляемости голосовых связок. Исследования показывают, что
длительное пребывание в загрязнённой среде может привести к хроническому
ларингиту, астме и другим заболеваниям дыхательных путей.
Аллергические реакции на пыльцу, пыль или другие раздражитель также могут
влиять на голосовые связки, вызывая их воспаление. Особенно подвержены этому
вокалисты, которые проводят много времени на открытом воздухе или в помещениях с
плохой вентиляцией. В холодную погоду, когда воздух сухой, голосовые связки теряют
влагу, что делает их более подверженными повреждениям. Известно, что певцы часто
страдают от воспалений и сухости в горле в зимний период из-за холодных и сухих
условий.
Неправильная гигиена голоса.
Неправильная гигиена голоса — это один из самых распространённых факторов,
способствующих заболеваниям голосового аппарата. Употребление холодных напитков,
особенно после пения или длительных репетиций, может вызвать шоковое воздействие
на голосовые связки и привести к их воспалению. Врачи часто рекомендуют избегать
напитков, содержащих кофеин, спиртные напитки или сильно охлаждённые жидкости,
так как они могут раздражать гортань и снижать её работоспособность.
Неправильное питание также может способствовать заболеваниям голосового
аппарата. Например, острые блюда или слишком горячие напитки могут вызвать
раздражение слизистой оболочки гортани. Интенсивные голосовые упражнения без
должного отдыха и восстановления также негативно сказываются на голосовых связках.
Существуют рекомендации по техникам голосового отдыха и восстановительных
упражнений, которые помогают избежать хронического напряжения.
Стресс и психоэмоциональное состояние.
316

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Стресс, нервозность и беспокойство оказывают мощное воздействие на голосовой
аппарат, особенно у профессиональных певцов и артистов. Психоэмоциональное
состояние напрямую связано с функцией голосовых связок: в состоянии стресса или
тревоги мышцы шеи и горла могут напряжённо сокращаться, что нарушает нормальную
работу голосового аппарата. Это может привести к фонации с зажатым или слабо
звучащим голосом. Певцы часто испытывают стресс перед важными выступлениями или
при подготовке к концертам, что приводит к снижению их вокальной способности и даже
к повреждению голосовых связок.
Научные исследования, например работы П. М. Берендова «Психология
исполнительства», показывают, что повышение уровня стресса ведёт к сокращению
объёма дыхания, нарушению координации вокальной фразы и повышению напряжения
в области шеи и горла. Более того, длительное пребывание в стрессовом состоянии может
спровоцировать хронические заболевания, такие как голосовые узелки, полипы и
воспаление голосовых связок.
Меры предосторожности заболеваний голосового аппарата.
Необходимые профилактические меры для обеспечения и сохранения здоровья
голосового аппарата.
1. Выработка навыков правильной вокальной техники- Педагог по вокалу с первую
очередь должен научить студента контролировать свой голосовой аппарат, беречь
здоровье голосового аппарата, к правильному дыханию во время исполнения, сохранять
диапазон звука во время пения.
2. Избежание чрезмерной эксплуатации голосового аппарата- ограничение
голосовых упражнений и занятий, необходимость отдыха для голосового аппарата.
3. Соблюдение гигиены голоса- употребление достаточного количества воды для
обеспечения здоровья голосового аппарата, отказ от холодных напитков и жирной пищи.
4. Учитывание экологических факторов- запаривание голосового аппарата для его
увлажнения, избегать сухой и грязный воздух.
5. Сохранение психоэмоционального баланса- уменьшение стрессовых моментов,
стремление к сохранению естественного тембра голоса, занятие медитацией и
дыхательными упражнениями.
Внедрение профилактических мер в процесс вокального образования.
В рамках дисциплины "Академическое вокальное исполнительство"
рекомендуется организовать специальные занятия по защите голоса. Эти занятия дают
студентам возможность:
1. Познать анатомию и физиологию голосового аппарата.
2. Изучить методы правильной эксплуатации голоса при голосовых упражнениях.
3. Быть проинформированными о возможных заболеваниях голосового аппарата и
их профилактики.

4. Меры предосторожности потенциальных заболеваний и знание их
предотвращения при их возникновении.
Вывод
Академический вокал необходим для того, чтобы улучшить качество звучания и
профессиональную деятельность. Он включает в себя не только технические аспекты
исполнения, но и глубинное понимание физиологических процессов, происходящих в
голосовом аппарате. Основными факторами заболеваний голосового аппарата являются
нарушения техники нотного вокала, повышенная утомляемость, экологические факторы
(загрязнение воздуха, изменение климата), а также стрессовые нагрузки, которые могут
влиять как на физическое состояние, так и на психологическое восприятие исполнения.
Из жизненного опыта многих оперных певцов можно выделить, что одна из
главных проблем, с которой сталкиваются вокалисты — это голосовая утомляемость и
перенапряжение голосовых связок. Певцы рассказывают, что длительные репетиции и
выступления без должной вокальной разминки и отдыха могут привести к хроническим
проблемам с голосом. Примером является опыт знаменитой оперной певицы Марии
Каллас, которая, несмотря на выдающийся голос и техническое мастерство, в
определённый момент столкнулась с серьёзными проблемами со здоровьем голосовых
связок, что сильно повлияло на её карьеру. Она не раз подчеркивала важность
правильной тренировки голоса и соблюдения режима.
Таким образом, в процессе обучения вокалу учащимся необходимо понимать
особенности развития голосового аппарата, их индивидуальные особенности, а также
проводить специальные профилактические тренировки, направленные на укрепление
голосовых связок и развитие правильного дыхания. Важным аспектом является
профилактика голосовых заболеваний с использованием методов фониатрии и
пульмонологии, направленных на сохранение здоровья голосовых связок, и на
предотвращение их перенапряжения.
В учебных пособиях по вокальной педагогике часто встречаются рекомендации,
касающиеся правильной вокальной разминки, которая помогает избежать
перенапряжения голосовых связок. Одним из ключевых принципов является не только
техника дыхания, но и осознание своего физического состояния. Многие оперные певцы,
такие как Фёдор Шаляпин, подчеркивали важность правильной осанки и расслабления
мышц перед выступлением. Оперные педагоги из разных школ рекомендуют
начинающим певцам следить за состоянием шеи и грудной клетки, избегая напряжения
в этих зонах, что помогает поддерживать длительный и качественный голосовой поток.
Также стоит отметить, что для поддержания здоровья голосового аппарата важно
соблюдать режим голосовой гигиены, который включает регулярные перерывы в пении,
достаточное увлажнение воздуха и органов дыхания, а также избежание чрезмерных
нагрузок на голосовые связки. Применение методик дыхательной гимнастики и
вокальной разминки помогает избежать профессиональных заболеваний среди певцов.
318

Например, Джеймс Лоудермилк, известный вокальный педагог, в своём учебном
пособии «Vocal Technique: A Guide for Singers» рекомендует певцам проводить
регулярные упражнения на расслабление и дыхание, чтобы поддерживать здоровье
голосовых связок в долгосрочной перспективе.
Психологическая подготовка к исполнительству и сцене также является
неотъемлемой частью обучения вокалу. Оперные певцы, такие как Пласидо Доминго,
рассказывали о том, как важен внутренний настрой перед каждым выступлением.
Психологическая самоподготовка помогает снизить уровень стресса, улучшить
уверенность в себе и настроиться на успешное исполнение. В учебных пособиях по
психологии исполнительства, например, в работах Барбары Киндер и Джеймса Райса,
часто упоминается важность разработки индивидуальных стратегий для снижения
нервозности и фокуса внимания на процессе исполнения.
Развитие сценической харизмы и способность работать с аудиторией играют
важную роль в карьере профессионального певца. Из жизненных опытов оперных
исполнителей можно заметить, что уверенность на сцене приходит с годами, однако для
успешного начала карьеры важны поддержка педагога и психологическая подготовка,
основанная на самоанализе и конструктивной обратной связи.
Кроме того, психологическая самоподготовка преподавателя и студента в будущем
станет важной основой для его педагогической и научной деятельности, обеспечивая не
только теоретическую, но и практическую подготовку к взаимодействию с учениками, а
также к проведению научных исследований в области вокальной педагогики.
По наблюдениям и исследованиям, для профессионального исполнения
академического вокала требуется знание множества дисциплин, включая музыку,
психологию, физиологию, медицину и нейробиологию. В последние годы всё большее
внимание уделяется изучению влияния нейробиологии на голосовую технику, а также
пониманию того, как психоэмоциональное состояние влияет на качество звука. В
учебниках по вокальной физиологии, таких как «The Voice: How to Use It» Х. К. Лаусона,
описывается, как психоэмоциональные переживания певца могут прямо влиять на его
голос. В этой области также наблюдается рост интереса к методам
нейрофизиологического воздействия на улучшение вокальных способностей.
Для профессионалов важно знание принципов вокальной акустики, физиологии
дыхания и фонопедии, которые позволяют не только правильно развивать голос, но и
эффективно лечить возникшие заболевания. Например, в книге Н. И. Тихонова
«Фониатрия и вокальная терапия» акцентируется внимание на необходимости
междисциплинарного подхода, включая сочетание вокальной техники и медицинских
рекомендаций.
Таким образом, академический вокал требует комплексного подхода, который
включает как физическую, так и психологическую подготовку, медицинские знания и

практическое применение методик, направленных на долгосрочное сохранение здоровья
и развитие голосовых способностей.
Заключение.
Осознание важности бережного отношения к голосовому аппарату должно стать
неотъемлемой частью обучения академическому вокалу. Голос — это не просто
инструмент, а отражение физического и психологического состояния исполнителя. К
сожалению, студенты зачастую недостаточно информированы о факторах,
способствующих заболеваниям голосовых связок: неправильная техника дыхания,
чрезмерная нагрузка, отсутствие вокального режима, стрессы и даже общее состояние
здоровья.
В процессе обучения академическому вокальному исполнительству необходимо
формировать у студентов культуру профессионального отношения к своему голосу.
Преподаватель должен не только обучать вокальной технике, но и быть наставником в
вопросах гигиены голоса, правильного речевого и вокального режима, а также
профилактики профессиональных заболеваний.
Эффективными методами профилактики являются: регулярные дыхательные
упражнения, голосовая разминка, контроль за уровнем влажности воздуха, избегание
переохлаждения, а также развитие общей физической выносливости. Немаловажно
также формировать у студентов навыки самонаблюдения и своевременного обращения к
фониатру при первых признаках перенапряжения.
Таким образом, комплексный подход к обучению вокалу, включающий
медицинскую и психологическую просвещенность, помогает не только развить
исполнительское мастерство, но и сохранить главный ресурс вокалиста — здоровый и
выразительный голос.

Kirish.
Har bir xalqning ma’naviy dunyosini, tarixiy xotirasini va madaniy merosini aks
ettiruvchi muhim vositalardan biri bu – uning musiqasidir. Musiqa esa, ayniqsa, cholg‘u san’ati
orqali yanada chuqur va ta’sirli ifoda topadi. O‘zbek xalqining boy musiqiy merosi, asrlar osha
avloddan-avlodga o‘tib, turli shakl va yo‘nalishlarda taraqqiy etib kelmoqda. Shu jihatdan
qaralganda, o‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari nafaqat milliy musiqa asarlarining jamoaviy ijrosini
ta’minlovchi ansambllar, balki o‘zbek xalqining musiqiy madaniyatini jonli saqlovchi, uni
zamon ruhiga mos tarzda rivojlantiruvchi ijodiy maktablardir.
O‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari XX asr boshlarida shakllana boshlagan bo‘lsa-da,
bugungi kunda ular o‘zining mukammal ijro texnikasi, boy repertuari va pedagogik salohiyati
bilan milliy musiqa san’atining muhim yo‘nalishiga aylangan. Ushbu orkestrlar xalq
cholg‘ularini yangicha tarzda talqin qilish, ularni jamoaviy ijro orqali ommaga taqdim etish,
shuningdek, yosh ijrochilarni milliy musiqaga bo‘lgan mehr-oqibat ruhida tarbiyalashda katta
rol o‘ynaydi. Ayniqsa, cholg‘u ijrochiligining jamoaviy shaklini rivojlantirish, yangi
kompozitsiyalar yaratish va ularni sahnaga olib chiqishda bu orkestrlarning hissasi beqiyosdir.
Bugungi globallashuv sharoitida xalq cholg‘u orkestrlarining faoliyati nafaqat milliy
san’atni saqlash, balki uni dunyoga tanitish, xalqaro madaniy muloqotda faol ishtirok etish
imkoniyatini ham beradi. Shu bois, ushbu maqolada o‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlarining cholg‘u
ijrochiligi rivojidagi roli, ularning tarixiy taraqqiyoti, ijodiy faoliyati va pedagogik ahamiyati
haqida fikr yuritiladi.
O‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari o‘zining boy tarixi va ijodiy salohiyati bilan cholg‘u
ijrochiligi taraqqiyotida beqiyos o‘rin egallaydi. Dastlab, milliy cholg‘ular yakka ijroda, asosan,
xalq bayramlari, marosimlari va yig‘inlarda qo‘llanilgan bo‘lsa, keyinchalik bu cholg‘ular
asosida jamoaviy ijro an’anasi shakllandi. Ayniqsa, XX asr boshlaridan boshlab, O‘zbekistonda
musiqiy ta’lim tizimining rivojlanishi, professional san’at maktablarining tashkil etilishi va
davlat tomonidan milliy san’atga e’tibor ortishi bu jarayonni jadallashtirdi.
O‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari o‘zbek milliy cholg‘ulari – doira, dutor, gijjak, rubob,
tor, nay, karnay-surnay kabi cholg‘ularni jamlab, ularni uyg‘un va musiqiy jamoa sifatida
323

birlashtirish orqali o‘ziga xos musiqiy palitrani yaratdi. Ayniqsa, ilk xalq cholg‘u
orkestrlarining asoschilaridan biri bo‘lgan T. Jalilovning xizmatlari tahsinga loyiq. U o‘zbek
xalq cholg‘ularining imkoniyatlarini chuqur o‘rgangan, ularni orkestr ijrosiga moslashtirgan va
birinchi namunaviy orkestr namunalarini yaratgan san’atkorlardan biridir.
Xalq cholg‘u orkestrlarining repertuari ham o‘ziga xos. Unda nafaqat an’anaviy xalq kuyqo‘shiqlari, balki zamonaviy kompozitorlar tomonidan yaratilgan asarlar, xalq kuylariga
ishlovlar ham keng o‘rin olgan. Bu holat o‘zbek cholg‘u ijrochiligini rivojlantirish bilan birga,
uni yangilash, turli uslublar bilan boyitish imkonini ham yaratadi. Orkestrlarda har bir cholg‘u
o‘z o‘rniga ega bo‘lib, ular o‘ziga xos tembr va ritmik rang-baranglik kiritadi. Bu esa cholg‘u
ijrosini yanada boy, dinamik va hissiyotga to‘la qiladi.
Shu bilan birga, xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari pedagogik jihatdan ham katta ahamiyatga ega.
Musiqa maktablari, kollejlar va konservatoriyalarda faoliyat yuritayotgan orkestrlar yosh
ijrochilarni nafaqat texnik mahoratga, balki jamoaviy ijro madaniyatiga, milliy musiqaga mehr
bilan yondashishga o‘rgatadi. Bu orkestrlar ijrochilik maktabining shakllanishi, tajriba
almashinuvi va yangi kompozitsion yondashuvlarning yaratilishida mustahkam zamin bo‘lib
xizmat qiladi. Bugungi kunda o‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari nafaqat respublika miqyosida,
balki xalqaro sahnalarda ham faol ishtirok etmoqda. Ularning ijrosi orqali o‘zbek xalqining boy
musiqiy madaniyati dunyo xalqlariga tanitilmoqda. Shu jihatdan olganda, bu orkestrlar xalq
musiqasini saqlash, uni kelajak avlodga yetkazish va zamonaviy sahnaga mos tarzda namoyon
etishda muhim madaniy ko‘prik vazifasini bajarmoqda.
Adabiyotlar tahlili (sharhi):
Cholg‘u ijrochiligi va xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari masalasiga oid ilmiy va amaliy adabiyotlar
tahlili shuni ko‘rsatadiki, bu yo‘nalish o‘zbek musiqa madaniyatining ajralmas qismi sifatida
chuqur o‘rganilgan va o‘zining nazariy asoslariga ega bo‘lgan sohaga aylangan.
Avvalo, musiqashunos olimlar T. Jalilov[1; 148], M. Nurmatov[4; 212], O.
Matyoqubov[3; 176] va boshqalar tomonidan yozilgan asarlarda xalq cholg‘u ijrochiligining
kelib chiqishi, tarixiy bosqichlari va rivojlanish jarayonlari keng yoritilgan. Jumladan, T.
Jalilovning asarlarida[1; 148] o‘zbek xalq cholg‘ularining orkestr tarkibida uyg‘unlashuvi,
ularning tembr va funksional imkoniyatlari haqida batafsil ma’lumotlar berilgan. Bu asarlar
orkestr kompozitsiyasini shakllantirishda asosiy manba bo‘lib xizmat qilgan.
O‘zbek xalq cholg‘ulari bo‘yicha yozilgan ilmiy tadqiqotlar, ayniqsa, ularning tasnifi,
sozlash usullari, ijro texnikasi va ansambl madaniyati haqidagi adabiyotlar orqali musiqiy
cholg‘ularning orkestr tarkibidagi o‘rni, ovoz balandligi va ijro uslublaridagi tafovutlar ilmiy
asosda tahlil qilingan.
Bundan tashqari, G‘. Ismailov, B. Sattorov[5; 47] va boshqa zamonaviy olimlarning
maqola va monografiyalarida xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari orqali yosh avlodni milliy ruhda
tarbiyalash, ularni musiqiy ijodkorlik faoliyatiga jalb etish va pedagogik jarayonlarda undan
samarali foydalanish yondashuvlari yoritilgan. Bu asarlar orqali xalq cholg‘u orkestrining
nafaqat san’at sohasi, balki ta’lim tizimidagi o‘rni ham chuqur ochib beriladi. Adabiyotlar tahlili
324

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

shuni ko‘rsatadiki, o‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari masalasi nafaqat tarixiy va ijrochilik
jihatdan, balki ijtimoiy-ma’naviy, estetik va tarbiyaviy nuqtayi nazardan ham muhim ilmiy
tadqiqotlarga asos bo‘lgan. Bu esa, mazkur mavzuning dolzarbligini va ilmiy-amaliy
ahamiyatini yana bir bor tasdiqlaydi.
Muhokama:
O‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari cholg‘u ijrochiligini jamoaviy shaklda rivojlantirish,
milliy musiqaning zamonaviy talqini va keng ommaga yetkazilishida strategik ahamiyat kasb
etadi. Muhokamaga sabab bo‘layotgan asosiy jihatlardan biri shuki, bu orkestrlar milliy
cholg‘ularning o‘zaro uyg‘unlikda, ansambl shaklida ijro etilish madaniyatini shakllantirdi va
rivojlantirdi. Natijada yakka ijrodan jamoaviy, orkestrga xos murakkab ijro texnikasiga o‘tish
jarayoni yuzaga keldi. Ilmiy manbalarda qayd etilishicha, o‘zbek xalq cholg‘ularining o‘ziga
xos tembr, dinamik imkoniyatlari va texnik murakkabliklari mavjud bo‘lib, ularni orkestrga
moslashtirish o‘z vaqtida muhim ilmiy-amaliy masalaga aylangan. Masalan, gijjak, rubob, dutor
kabi cholg‘ular yakka ijro uchun mo‘ljallangan bo‘lsa-da, xalq cholg‘u orkestrlarida ular guruhli
tarzda ijro etilishi uchun alohida sozlash, repertuar tanlovi va ansambl madaniyatini talab qiladi.
Bu esa ijrochilardan yuqori saviyadagi professional yondashuvni, sozanda va dirijyorlardan esa
estetik did va uslubiy tafakkurni talab etadi.
Muhokamali jihatlardan yana biri – xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari repertuar siyosatidir.
Bugungi kunda ba’zi orkestrlar asosan xalq kuy-qo‘shiqlarini ijro etish bilan cheklanib
qolayotgan bo‘lsa, ayrim orkestrlar esa zamonaviy kompozitorlarning asarlari va xorij
musiqasini ham o‘z repertuariga kiritmoqda. Bu ikki yondashuv o‘rtasida muvozanat saqlanishi
zarur: bir tomondan, milliy musiqiy merosni asrab-avaylash va targ‘ib etish, ikkinchi tomondan
esa ijrochilik doirasini kengaytirish, yosh avlod didini boyitish va musiqiy tafakkurni
rivojlantirish.
Pedagogik nuqtayi nazardan qaralganda, xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari musiqiy ta’lim
tizimining ajralmas qismiga aylangan. Musiqa maktablari, san’at kollejlarida orkestr
sinflarining mavjudligi yosh iqtidorlarni erta aniqlash, ularni ijodiy jamoalarda tarbiyalash va
professional sahnaga tayyorlashda muhim ahamiyatga ega. Shu bilan birga, orkestrlar orqali
o‘quvchilar jamoaviylik, mas’uliyat, intizom, eshituv madaniyati, ijodiy hamkorlik kabi
ijtimoiy-pedagogik ko‘nikmalarga ega bo‘ladilar.
Biroq, muhokama davomida ayrim muammoli jihatlar ham mavjudligini inkor etib
bo‘lmaydi. Jumladan, ayrim hududiy musiqiy tashkilotlarda xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari uchun
zaruriy asbob-uskunalar, notalar, zamonaviy didaktik materiallar yetishmasligi kuzatilmoqda.
Bundan tashqari, yosh sozandalarni orkestr ijrochiligiga jalb qilish, ularni milliy cholg‘ularni
chuqur o‘rganishga undash uchun motivatsion muhit va ijodiy muhitni yaratish dolzarb
masalalardan biri bo‘lib qolmoqda. O‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari nafaqat cholg‘u
ijrochiligining rivojlanishiga, balki milliy musiqa maktabining takomiliga, yosh avlodning
estetik tarbiyasi va madaniy ongining shakllanishiga xizmat qilayotgan muhim san’at

institutidir. Ularning rivojiga doir ilmiy-tadqiqotlar, metodik ishlar va davlat siyosatidagi
qo‘llab-quvvatlash jarayonlari yanada tizimli tus olishi lozim.
Xulosa.
Cholg‘u san’ati – bu nafaqat musiqiy ifoda vositasi, balki xalqning ichki ruhiy olami,
tarixi, qadriyatlari va estetik dunyoqarashining timsolidir. O‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari esa
ushbu boy merosni jamiyatga etkazuvchi, uni saqlab qoluvchi va zamon bilan hamnafas tarzda
yangilovchi kuchli madaniy vosita bo‘lib xizmat qilmoqda. Ularning ijrosi orqali asrlar
davomida shakllangan milliy cholg‘u merosi sahnalarda yangraydi, qalblarga yetib boradi va
yangi avlod qalbida estetik zavq, milliy g‘urur uyg‘otadi. Bugungi kunda xalq cholg‘u
orkestrlari faqatgina san’at jamoasi emas, balki tarbiya, ta’lim, madaniyat va jamiyat taraqqiyoti
uchun xizmat qiluvchi ijtimoiy institut sifatida ham faoliyat yuritmoqda. Ular orqali yosh
ijrochilar nafaqat musiqa sir-asrorlarini, balki jamoaviylik, fidoyilik, milliylik va san’atga
hurmat kabi yuksak insoniy fazilatlarni ham o‘zlashtiradilar.
Shu nuqtai nazardan qaraganda, xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari faoliyatining har tomonlama
rivojlanishini ta’minlash, ularni metodik, texnik va moddiy jihatdan qo‘llab-quvvatlash,
ayniqsa, ularni ta’lim tizimi bilan integratsiyalash bugungi kunning muhim vazifalaridan biridir.
Zero, milliy cholg‘ularimiz navolari ostida tarbiya topgan avlod – bu nafaqat san’atni sevuvchi,
balki o‘z xalqining tarixini, madaniyatini qadrlaydigan, ma’naviy barkamol avlod bo‘ladi.
Demak, o‘zbek xalq cholg‘u orkestrlari nafaqat o‘z davrining mahsuli, balki kelajakka
yo‘naltirilgan ma’naviy-madaniy harakatning muhim bir bo‘g‘inidir. Ularning ijodiy
salohiyatini rivojlantirish, musiqiy merosni yangicha qiyofada taqdim etish orqali biz
o‘zligimizni anglaymiz, tariximizni eslaymiz va kelajak sari ishonch bilan boramiz.

Kirish.
Musiqa – bu inson qalbining tilidir. U insoniyat tarixida eng qadimiy va kuchli tarbiyaviy
vosita bo‘lib, xalq ruhiyatining, urf-odatlari va milliy qadriyatlarining ifodasidir. O‘zbek
xalqining musiqiy merosi esa dunyo madaniyati xazinasida alohida o‘rin egallaydi. Bu bebaho
meros ichida dutor cholg‘usi alohida o‘rin tutadi. Uning ohangida xalqning dardi, quvonchi,
orzu-umidlari, muhabbati va fidoyiligi mujassam. Shu sababli, bugungi kunda bo‘lajak musiqa
madaniyati o‘qituvchilarini tayyorlashda dutor ijrochiligini o‘rgatish – nafaqat kasbiy mahorat,
balki ma'naviy va estetik tarbiyaning ajralmas qismi hisoblanadi.
Musiqa madaniyati fani o‘qituvchisi – bu nafaqat bilim beruvchi, balki yosh avlod
qalbiga san’at muhabbatini singdiruvchi, uni milliy qadriyatlarga hurmat ruhida tarbiyalovchi
shaxsdir. Shuning uchun ham ushbu soha vakillari o‘z kasbiy tayyorgarligida ijrochilik
mahoratini egallashi zarur. Ayniqsa, dutor cholg‘usida to‘g‘ri va ta’sirchan ijro eta olish,
o‘quvchilarga ushbu san’at orqali milliy musiqa madaniyatining nozik jihatlarini anglatish
imkonini beradi.
Zamonaviy ta’limda musiqiy cholg‘ular orqali ijrochilikni shakllantirish jarayoni nafaqat
texnik bilimlar, balki did, hissiyot va sahna madaniyatini ham talab etadi. Bu esa o‘qituvchidan
chuqur metodik tayyorgarlik, an’anaviy ijrochilik maktablariga hurmat va zamonaviy
yondashuvlarni uyg‘unlashtirishni talab qiladi. Ayniqsa, dutor – bu oddiy cholg‘u emas, u bilan
til topishish, ohang bilan suhbatlashish – mahorat va fidoyilikni talab qiladi.
Shu bois, mazkur maqolada bo‘lajak musiqa madaniyati fani o‘qituvchilarida dutor
cholg‘usida ijrochilik ko‘nikmalarini shakllantirishning dolzarb jihatlari, o‘quv jarayonida
qo‘llaniladigan samarali metodlar va uslublar, hamda milliy qadriyatlarni yosh avlod ongiga
singdirishda ushbu ko‘nikmalarning tutgan o‘rni tahlil etiladi.
Metodologiya:
Har qanday pedagogik tadqiqotning poydevori – bu uning metodologik asoslaridir.
Chunki o‘rganilayotgan muammoni chuqur tahlil qilish, aniq maqsadlarga erishish va xulosalar
chiqarish aynan to‘g‘ri tanlangan metodologik yondashuvga bog‘liq. Mazkur tadqiqotda
bo‘lajak musiqa madaniyati fani o‘qituvchilarida dutor cholg‘usida ijrochilik ko‘nikmalarini
shakllantirish jarayoniga yangicha nazar bilan qarash, nafaqat ilmiy-nazariy, balki amaliy
metodik yondashuvlar orqali ham mavjud muammoni hal qilish maqsad qilindi.

Ushbu ilmiy izlanishda asosiy metod sifatida nazariy tahlil, pedagogik kuzatuv, amaliy
tajriba-sinov ishlari, so‘rovnoma va suhbatlar, shuningdek ijroiy faoliyatni tahlil qilish kabi
usullar qo‘llanildi. Nazariy tahlil orqali musiqa pedagogikasi, milliy cholg‘u san’ati, xususan
dutor ijrochiligi bo‘yicha mavjud adabiyotlar, ilg‘or tajribalar va tarixiy manbalar o‘rganildi.
Bu esa mavzuning ilmiy asoslarini mustahkamlashga xizmat qildi.
Pedagogik kuzatuv va tajriba-sinov ishlari esa musiqiy ta’lim jarayonida talabalarning
ijrochilik malakalarini qanday shakllantirayotganini bevosita ko‘rib chiqish imkonini berdi.
O‘quv mashg‘ulotlarida talabalar bilan olib borilgan interaktiv metodlar, guruhlarda ishlash,
ijodiy topshiriqlar va sahna chiqishlari tahlil qilinib, ularning samaradorligi baholandi. Ayniqsa,
dutor cholg‘usining texnik jihatlarini o‘rgatishda ko‘rgazmali usullar, videodarslar va ustozshogird an’analari asosida tashkil etilgan mashg‘ulotlar o‘zining ijobiy natijasini berdi.
Shuningdek, talabalar va ularning o‘qituvchilari bilan olib borilgan suhbatlar orqali
ijrochilikka bo‘lgan munosabat, qiyinchiliklar va ehtiyojlar aniqlab borildi. Bu ma’lumotlar
asosida yangi, amaliyotga yaqin metodik yondashuvlar ishlab chiqildi.
Metodologik jihatdan bu tadqiqot shaxsga yo‘naltirilgan yondashuv, kompetensiyaviy
yondashuv va faoliyatga asoslangan ta’lim modeli asosida olib borildi. Zero, bo‘lajak
o‘qituvchining ijrochilik mahorati faqat bilim emas, balki amaliy ko‘nikma, estetik did,
madaniy ong va milliy o‘zlikni anglash bilan chambarchas bog‘liqdir.
Adabiyotlar tahlili (sharhi):
Bo‘lajak musiqa madaniyati fani o‘qituvchilarida dutor cholg‘usida ijrochilik
ko‘nikmalarini shakllantirish bilan bog‘liq masalalarni chuqur o‘rganish jarayonida mavjud
ilmiy va uslubiy adabiyotlar muhim metodologik asos bo‘lib xizmat qiladi. O‘zbekiston musiqa
san’atiga oid ilmiy manbalar, metodik qo‘llanmalar, maqolalar hamda xalq ijodiyotiga
bag‘ishlangan tadqiqotlar ushbu mavzuning nazariy va amaliy asoslarini yoritib beradi.
Avvalo, o‘zbek milliy cholg‘ularining kelib chiqishi, ularning tuzilishi va ijro uslublarini
o‘rgangan mutaxassislar, jumladan, A. S. Qosimov[1; 176], O. Matyoqubov[2; 192], H. T.
Tojiboyev[3; 128] kabi olimlarning ishlari dutor cholg‘usining o‘ziga xosligi, uning o‘quv
jarayonidagi o‘rni va metodik asoslarini yoritishda muhim manba hisoblanadi. Ayniqsa,
dutorning tovush imkoniyatlari, pozitsion o‘yin texnikasi, milliy uslubdagi kuylarni ijro
etishdagi mahorat talablari ushbu adabiyotlarda chuqur tahlil qilingan.
Shuningdek, musiqa pedagogikasiga oid manbalar, masalan, Sh. A. Rahimov[8; 136], R.
M. Jo‘rayev[5; 160], N. M. G‘ulomovlarning[6; 120] tadqiqotlarida o‘qituvchining kasbiy
kompetensiyasi, ijrochilik faoliyatining psixologik-pedagogik jihatlari, shuningdek, talabalarda
musiqiy ko‘nikmalarni shakllantirishda amaliy mashg‘ulotlarning roli yoritilgan. Bu asarlar
bo‘lajak o‘qituvchilarning ijrochilik tayyorgarligini samarali tashkil etishda zarur bo‘lgan
nazariy bilimlarni beradi.
Dutor ijrochiligiga oid metodik qo‘llanmalar – ayniqsa, musiqiy maktab va kollejlar
uchun yaratilgan darsliklar (S. T. Zokirov[4; 144], N. T. Ochildiyev[7; 98] kabi mualliflar)
329

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

amaliy mashg‘ulotlarni tashkil etish, kuylarni bosqichma-bosqich o‘rgatish usullari, musiqiy
nutqni rivojlantirish va didaktik materiallar bilan boyitilganligi sababli dolzarb ahamiyatga ega.
Bundan tashqari, xalq cholg‘ulari ijrochiligi va o‘rgatish metodikasi bo‘yicha Rossiya va
boshqa xorijiy mamlakatlarda olib borilgan tadqiqotlar ham tahlil qilindi. Ular asosan
pedagogik texnologiyalar, innovatsion yondashuvlar va ijrochilikni baholash mezonlari bilan
bog‘liq bo‘lib, ularni o‘zbek an’anaviy ijrochilik maktabi bilan taqqoslab, moslashtirish orqali
yangicha yondashuvlar ishlab chiqish imkonini beradi.
Umuman olganda, adabiyotlar sharhi shuni ko‘rsatadiki, dutor ijrochiligini o‘rgatishda
milliy an’analar bilan zamonaviy metodlarni uyg‘unlashtirish, bo‘lajak o‘qituvchilarda musiqiy
tafakkur va ijodiy yondashuvni rivojlantirishga alohida e’tibor qaratilmoqda. Bu esa mazkur
mavzuni o‘rganishda chuqur ilmiy-tadqiqot olib borish zarurligini anglatadi.
Muhokama:
Bugungi ta’lim jarayoni – bu nafaqat bilim berish, balki shaxsni har tomonlama
shakllantirish, undagi estetik dunyoqarash, milliy ong va ijodiy tafakkurni rivojlantirish
jarayonidir. Ayniqsa, musiqa madaniyati fani o‘qituvchilari uchun bu jarayon ikki barobar
mas’uliyatlidir. Chunki ular nafaqat o‘zlari badiiy-estetik didga ega bo‘lishlari, balki bu didni
kelajak avlodga singdirishdek yuksak vazifani ham bajaradilar. Mazkur tadqiqotda esa ana shu
vazifaning muhim bo‘g‘ini bo‘lgan dutor ijrochiligi ko‘nikmalarini shakllantirish masalasi
atroflicha muhokama qilindi.
Tahlillar shuni ko‘rsatmoqdaki, hozirgi kunda dutor ijrochiligini o‘qitishda ayrim
metodik kamchiliklar mavjud: o‘qitish jarayonida individual yondashuv yetarli darajada amalga
oshirilmaydi, amaliy mashg‘ulotlar ko‘proq texnikaga qaratilib, kuy mazmuni va badiiy
ifodaning o‘ziga xos jihatlari yetarlicha ochib berilmaydi. Bu holat, ayniqsa, o‘quvchi-yoshlar
bilan ishlaydigan bo‘lajak o‘qituvchilarning ijodiy yondashuvi va milliy musiqa asarlariga
badiiy munosabatining sustligiga olib kelishi mumkin.
Shuningdek, dutor cholg‘usining texnik va uslubiy murakkabliklari – kuylarni
pozitsiyalar asosida ijro etish, tovushning tozaligini ta’minlash, ritmik aniqlik va hissiy ifoda
bilan ijro etish – bu ko‘nikmalarni bosqichma-bosqich va puxta rejalashtirilgan mashg‘ulotlar
orqali shakllantirishni talab qiladi. Demak, metodik yondashuvlar chuqur o‘ylangan, shaxsga
yo‘naltirilgan va amaliyot bilan uyg‘un bo‘lishi kerak.
Muhokama jarayonida aniqlanganki, dutor ijrochiligini o‘rgatishda faqat an’anaviy
yondashuv yetarli emas. Interaktiv usullar, multimediya vositalari, zamonaviy texnologiyalarni
qo‘llash, shuningdek ustoz-shogird an’analarini yangicha talqinda tiklash kabi usullar ijrochilik
ko‘nikmalarini rivojlantirishda katta rol o‘ynaydi. Shu bilan birga, o‘quvchilarni milliy kuylar
bilan tanishtirish, ularning tarixiy asoslari va madaniy mazmunini tushuntirish orqali musiqiy
tarbiyaning ta’sirchanligini oshirish mumkin.
Eng muhimi, ijrochilik jarayonida talabada ijodiy tafakkur, sahna madaniyati, musiqiy
his-tuyg‘u va estetik zavqni uyg‘otish kerak. Bu esa o‘qituvchidan nafaqat kasbiy mahorat, balki
330

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

milliy madaniyatimizga chuqur hurmat va fidoyilikni talab etadi. Zero, dutor – bu millatning
yuragidan jo bo‘lgan ohang, uni his etish esa qalb bilan bog‘liq san’atdir.
Xulosa.
Har qanday millatning ma’naviy qiyofasi, eng avvalo, uning musiqasida, kuy va
navolarida o‘z ifodasini topadi. Dutor – bu shunchaki cholg‘u emas, balki o‘zbek xalqining
yuragidan jo bo‘lgan, dardu hasratini, orzu va shodligini ohanglar orqali so‘zlaydigan milliy
madaniyat timsolidir. Bo‘lajak musiqa madaniyati fani o‘qituvchilarining ushbu cholg‘uda ijro
etish malakasini egallashi — ular uchun nafaqat kasbiy, balki ma’naviy kamolot sari qo‘yilgan
muhim qadamlardan biridir.
Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, dutor cholg‘usida ijrochilik ko‘nikmalarini
shakllantirish bo‘lajak o‘qituvchining ijodiy tafakkuri, badiiy-estetik didi, milliy
qadriyatlarimizga bo‘lgan munosabati va sahna madaniyatini yuksaltirishda muhim ahamiyatga
ega. Bu yo‘ldagi yondashuvlar chuqur o‘ylangan, shaxsga yo‘naltirilgan va amaliyot bilan uzviy
bog‘langan bo‘lishi kerak. O‘qitish jarayonida an’anaviy maktab tajribalarini zamonaviy
pedagogik texnologiyalar bilan uyg‘unlashtirish, ijrochilik jarayoniga innovatsion metodlarni
tatbiq etish dolzarb vazifalardan hisoblanadi.
Eng asosiysi, bu jarayon orqali bo‘lajak o‘qituvchilar dildan ijro etish, kuy orqali histuyg‘ularni ifodalash, o‘quvchilarda musiqaga mehr uyg‘otish kabi nozik, ammo muhim
jihatlarni egallab boradilar. Ular nafaqat cholg‘uni chalishni, balki uning ruhini, ohangini,
falsafasini his etishni o‘rganadilar. Zero, bu san’at – yurak bilan ijro etiladigan, millatning ruhiy
boyligini asrlar ortidan olib keladigan bebaho xazina.
Shunday ekan, dutor ijrochiligini o‘rgatish va bu orqali bo‘lajak musiqa madaniyati
o‘qituvchilarini tarbiyalash – kelajak avlodni musiqiy-estetik ruhda, milliy g‘urur va
qadriyatlarga sodiqlik bilan kamolga yetkazish yo‘lidagi muhim qadamdir. Bu borada olib
borilayotgan ilmiy-ijodiy izlanishlar esa bu yuksak maqsad sari dadil yo‘l ochadi.

KIRISH. Bugungi kunda yosh avlodni har tomonlama barkamol inson sifatida voyaga
yetkazish – jamiyat oldidagi eng muhim vazifalardan biridir. Shu yo‘lda turli tarbiyaviy
vositalar qo‘llaniladi, ulardan biri esa – musiqadir. Musiqa inson ruhiyatiga, fikrlash tarziga,
332

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

axloqiy qarashlariga bevosita ta’sir ko‘rsatadigan kuchli estetik vositadir. Ayniqsa, yoshlarning
ma’naviy kamolotida musiqaning tutgan o‘rni beqiyosdir.
ADABIYOTLAR TAHLILI VA METODLAR. Kundan kunga rivojlanib borayotgan
ona diyorimiz aziz va mo`tabar O`zbekistonimizda bugun o`zgarishlar ulkan, maqsadlar oliy.
Bugungi ilg`or texnologiyalardan foydalanish asrida yurtimizda barcha javhada tubdan
o`zgarishlar sodir bo`layotgani barchamizga ma`lum. Jamiyatdagi har bir sohada jumaladan
iqtisodiyot, tibbiyot, ta`lim, mashinasozlik, elektroenergetika, avaiatsiya va boshqa sohalardagi
rivojlanshar bir daqiqa ham to`xtab qolgani yo`q. Shular jumlasidan zamonga mos keladigan
yosh avlodni tarbiyalash, ularni keng fikrli va iqtidorli, o`z kasbining yetuk mutaxassisi bo`lib
yetishi uchun yangidan yangi o`quv texnologiyalari, dasturlari ishlab chiqilmoqda. O`quvchi va
talaba yoshlarni bilim olishlarni uchun barcha imkoniyatlar keng va zamon talabalariga mos
ravishda jihozlangan auditoriya va o`quv xonalarining mavjudligi, turli xil sport va san`at
makatablari, til o`rganishlari uchun maxsus til o`rganish o`quv markazlarining mavjudligi
bugun ularni dunyo hamjamiyatida ham yuqori martaba erishishlari uchundir. Bugun har bir
ota-ona o`z farzandi kelajagiga befarq qolmaslikka intilishi yoshlarning ilmga bo`lgan qiziqish
va imkoniyatlarini kuchytirmoqda Shu jumladan ta`lim tizimidagi bo`layotgan islohatlar hech
kimni befarq qoldirmasdan qo`ygani yo`q.
Davlatimiz prezidenti Shavkat Miromonovich Mirziyoyev yangi yil boshidan o`z diqqat
e`tiborlarini ta`lim sohasidagi islohotlarga qaratganliklari buning yaqqol dalilidir. 2022-yilning
yanavar oyida o`tkazgan Maktab ta`limini rivojlantirishga oid yig`ilishida bejizga “Najot
ta`limda, najot tarbiyada, najot bilimda” – deb fikr bildirmadilar yutrboshimiz. Sababi go`zal
va ulug`vor vatanimiz kelajagi biz yoshlarning qo`lidadir. Yangi O`zbekistonimizning gullab
yashnashi, rivojlanishi, dunyo hamjamiyati oldida yuqori o`rinilardan joy egallashi faqat va
faqat biz yoshlarning egallagan bilim va ko`nikmalarimizga bog`liqdir. Yurtboshimiz o`z
nutqlarida shuni ham ta`kidlab o`tishdiki, ta`lim tizimida ko`p vaqt yo`qotganimiz. Bugun
ta`lim va tarbiyaga e`tibor qaratmasak uni isloh qilmasak, ta`lim tizimiga faqat Xalq ta`limi
vazirligi javobgar deb sanab butun bir jamiyat e`tibozsiz qoldirsak bu juda katta xato ekanligini
aytib o`tdilar. Tinch va osoyishta diyorimizda yosh avlodga ta`lim tarbiya berish va ularni
yurtimiz ravnaqi va kelajagi uchun o`z xissasini qo`shadigan ilg`or bilimli va keng fikrlaydigan
shaxs qilib shakllantirish bugungi kunimizdagi muhim va dolzarb vazifalarimizdan biri.
Jumladan, mustaqillik yillarida yurtimizda keng qamrovli iqtisodiy-siyosiy o`zgarishlar ro`y
bergani barchaga ma`lum. Ko`plab sohalar singari xalq ta`limi tizimida ham ko`pdan ko`p
ijobiy o`zgarishlar amalga oshirildi.
Musiqa bolalikdan boshlab inson shaxsini shakllantirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Qo‘shiq
va kuylar orqali yoshlar ezgulikka, vatanparvarlikka, mehr-oqibatga, sabr-toqat va do‘stlik kabi
ijobiy fazilatlarga yo‘naltiriladi. Ayniqsa, milliy musiqamiz – maqomlar, xalq qo‘shiqlari,
an’anaviy cholg‘ularimiz yoshlar qalbida o‘z millatiga hurmat, tarixiy o‘zlikni anglash
tuyg‘usini shakllantiradi.

Musiqiy tarbiya bolaning estetik didini oshiradi, ijodkorligini rivojlantiradi va hissiy
dunyosini boyitadi. Yoshlarning musiqa bilan shug‘ullanishi ularni erkin fikrlashga, o‘zini ifoda
eta olishga, sahnada o‘zini tutish madaniyatini o‘rganishga yordam beradi. Aynan shu jihatlar
yoshlarni kelajakda faol, madaniyatli va yetuk shaxs bo‘lib voyaga yetishiga zamin yaratadi.
Bundan tashqari, musiqa stressni kamaytirish, emotsional muvozanatni saqlashda ham
foydali hisoblanadi. Bu ayniqsa bugungi kunda – tezkor va shovqinli hayot sharoitida voyaga
yetayotgan yoshlar uchun dolzarbdir.
TAHLIL VA NATIJALAR. Yosh avlod tarbiyasi har qanday jamiyat uchun ustuvor
vazifa hisoblanadi. Ularning har tomonlama sog‘lom, bilimli, ma’naviy yetuk va estetik didga
ega insonlar bo‘lib voyaga yetishi kelajak taraqqiyoti uchun muhim omildir. Shu nuqtayi
nazardan qaraganda, musiqaning yoshlar tarbiyasidagi o‘rni alohida e’tiborga loyiqdir.
Musiqa inson ruhiyatiga bevosita ta’sir ko‘rsatuvchi vosita bo‘lib, u orqali yoshlarda
ezgulik, go‘zallik, mehr-oqibat, vatanparvarlik va boshqa ijobiy fazilatlar shakllanadi. Musiqa
nafaqat madaniy merosni yetkazuvchi vosita, balki yoshlarning hissiy holatini muvozanatga
keltiruvchi, stressni kamaytiruvchi, ruhiy sog‘liqni mustahkamlovchi kuchli omildir.Yoshlar
musiqa orqali o‘z his-tuyg‘ularini ifoda eta olishni, nutq madaniyatini, sahnada o‘zini tutish
qoidalarini, ijodiy yondashuvni o‘rganadilar. Ayniqsa, milliy musiqa – xalqimizning boy
madaniy merosi sifatida yosh avlod qalbida o‘zlikni anglash, milliy qadriyatlarga hurmat
tuyg‘usini rivojlantiradi. Maqom san’ati, folklor musiqasi, an’anaviy cholg‘u asboblari orqali
yoshlarda o‘z millatiga bo‘lgan muhabbat kuchayadi.
Musiqa ta’limi estetik tarbiyaning ajralmas qismi sifatida yoshlarning didini
shakllantiradi, ularga chiroy va go‘zallikni qadrlashni o‘rgatadi. Shu bilan birga, u shaxsiy
intizom, jamoada ishlash ko‘nikmalari, sabr-toqat kabi ijtimoiy muhim fazilatlarni
rivojlantirishga xizmat qiladi.
Bugungi kunda musiqa ta’limi faqat maxsus maktablarda emas, balki umumiy o‘rta
ta’lim muassasalarida ham keng joriy etilmoqda. Bu esa har bir bolaga o‘z iste’dodini namoyon
etish, ichki dunyosini boyitish imkonini beradi. Ayniqsa, maktabgacha va boshlang‘ich
yoshdagi bolalar bilan ishlashda musiqaning rolini oshirish – ularning har tomonlama uyg‘un
rivojlanishiga xizmat qiladi.
XULOSA. Musiqaning tarbiyaviy ahamiyati juda keng qamrovli bo‘lib, uni yoshlar
tarbiyasida samarali qo‘llash orqali jamiyatimizning madaniy va ma’naviy salohiyatini
yuksaltirish mumkin. Musiqa yoshlar tarbiyasida kuchli ma’naviy-estetik vosita bo‘lib, ularning
intellektual va emotsional salohiyatini yuksaltirishda muhim rol o‘ynaydi. Ota-onalar,
o‘qituvchilar va tarbiyachilar musiqa orqali yosh avlod qalbiga ezgulik, milliy g‘urur va ijodiy
tafakkurni singdirish orqali ularning yetuk shaxs bo‘lib shakllanishiga hissa qo‘shishlari
lozim.Shuning uchun ota-onalar, ustozlar va tarbiyachilar musiqaning tarbiyadagi roliga jiddiy
e’tibor qaratishlari zarur.

Abstract: The article is devoted to the identification of new methods of working with
vocal and melodic material in the opera parts of Rossini. Rossini, a supporter of the Italian bel
canto of the 18th century, preserved its main features in his operas. In this article, the author
worked on such complex issues as the short duration of vocal phrases in Rossini's operas, the
concentration of the melody in a comfortable tessitura, the saturation of all vocal parts
(including the bass) with coloratura, and the avoidance of a potentially dangerous transitional
register in fast and complex transitions.
Keywords: Giacomo Rossini, vocal melody, syllabic style, opera voice, bel canto,
musical heritage, orchestra, orchestral developments, musical innovations, coloratura, in vocal
parts, diapason, virtuoso technique, cadences, crescendo.
Italiya operasining taniqli tadqiqotchisi R. Cellettining fikricha, Joachino Rossini
asarlarining vokal uslubida uchta eng muhim komponentni ajratib ko'rsatish mumkin:
Birinchidan, bu bel kantoning merosi;
ikkinchidan, bastakorning o'zi tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan innovatsion xususiyatlar,
uchinchidan, muayyan vokal ovozlarning muayyan opera rollari bilan alohida aloqasi[3;
228-b.]
Rossini bel kanto san'atini yaxshi bilardi va bu 19-asr boshidagi yosh italyan bastakori
uchun g'ayrioddiy narsa emas edi. Ko‘pgina hamkasblari singari u ham musiqachi oilada
tug‘ilgan va bastakorlikdan oldin vokal mahoratini puxta egallagan. U Pesarodagi birinchi
qo'shiq saboqlarini onasidan, shuningdek, ruhoniy Juzeppe Malerbidan olgan. Oila Boloniyaga
ko'chib o'tganda (1805 yilda) Rossini hatto Del Korso teatrida Ferdinand Paerning "Kamilya"
operasi spektaklida ham o'ynadi. Keyin Rossini Boloniya litseyida (1806–09) tahsil oldi, u yerda
kontrapunkt va kompozitsiyadan tashqari vokal darslarida ham qatnashdi. Yosh musiqachining
vokal amaliyoti keyingi yillarda ham davom etdi, u Italiyaning turli teatrlarida xormeyster yoki
xonandalar uchun hamroh bo‘lib ishladi.
Bel kanto kompozitsion uslubiga kelsak, uning o'ziga xos xususiyatlari, birinchi
navbatda, qisqa (odatda to'rt bardan ko'p bo'lmagan), uzunligi bo'yicha deyarli bir xil bo'lgan
iboralarni o'z ichiga oladi. Bastakor ustaxonasidagi katta hamkasblari singari, Rossini ham
iboralarning davriyligi printsipi asosida vokal ohanglarni yaratdi. Buni kantilenada ham, mobil
virtuoz ariyalarda ham kuzatish mumkin. Masalan, Musoning “Aria Dal tuo stellato soglio”
(“Muso”), Ubertoning “Kavatina Oh fiamma soave” (“Ko‘l xonimi”) va Ninettaning “Kavatina
Di piacer mi balza il kor” (“O‘g‘ri so‘ng‘on”) asari. Bir qarashda, bu ariyalarning vokal ohangi
o'z-o'zidan rivojlanadi, lekin u davriylik tamoyiliga bo'ysunadi va sezura yoki orkestr epizodlari
bilan ajratilgan kichik iboralardan iborat. Iboralar orasidagi sezuralar xonandaga o'z vaqtida
nafas olish imkonini beradi va qo'shiqning tabiiyligi va ravonligiga hissa qo'shadi.
Bastakorning asosiy tashvishi xonandaning nafas olishining muntazamligi ekanligiga
ishonch hosil qilish uchun Rossinining istalgan o‘nta ariyasining, ayniqsa, kantilena
xarakteridagi ariyalarning ohang tuzilishini o‘rganish kifoya[2; 200-b.].

Ovozning moslashuvchanligi va chaqqonligi, ayniqsa, Rossinining har doim nafis
bezatilgan kantabili ijrosida zarur. Zamonaviy rassomlar Rossinining qismlarini juda murakkab
deb bilishlari mumkin: ularning ko'pchiligi o'zlarini qisqartirishga, bezak va kadenzalarni
o'tkazib yuborishga imkon beradi. Ammo o'sha paytda ular qo'shiq sahnasidan ketishi bastakor
tomonidan motam tutgan kastrati ariyalaridagi nafis koloraturalarning oddiy moslashuvi sifatida
qabul qilingan. Shunga qaramay, Rossini nuqtai nazaridan oddiy bo'lgan bezak xonandadan
benuqson poklikni talab qildi.
intonatsiya va mukammal legato. Zamondoshlarining fikriga ko'ra, Rossinining
primadonnalari va tenorlari nafaqat yaxshi o'qitilgan ovozlarga, balki rivojlangan badiiy didga
ham ega edilar, bu ularga hatto bezaklarda ham ifodalilikning nozik gradatsiyalarini namoyish
etishga imkon berdi.
Masalan, Tankred qismidagi bezaklar shahvoniylik va yorug‘lik bilan sug‘orilgan bo‘lsa,
Dezdemona qismida bezak nafis va chuqur ayanchli, Anna (Magomet II) qismidagi
koloraturalar qahramonlik pafosi bilan to‘ldirilgan va qo‘shiqning dramatik xarakterini
bildiradi.
XVIII asr italyan bel kantosining asosiy qoidalaridan biri. Ariyaning tessiturasi
qo'shiqchining imkoniyatlariga to'liq mos kelishi kerakligidan iborat edi. Rossini juda kamdankam hollarda juda past yoki juda baland tessiturali ariyalarni yozgan[1; 46–61-b.].
Rossini shuningdek, eski italyan bel kanto san'atidan matn va musiqa o'rtasidagi ikki xil
munosabatni meros qilib oldi, bu esa vokal mahorati darajasini va vokal uslubining xarakterini
belgilab berdi.
Birinchi tur bo‘g‘inli kuylash bo‘lib, matnning bir bo‘g‘iniga bir yoki ikkita nota mos
keladi;
Ikkinchi tur - vokal yoki ovozli qo'shiq: matnning har bir bo'g'inida cheksiz miqdordagi
notalar mavjud.
Qo'shiqning bo'g'in uslubida ham, vokallarda ham Rossini har doim qo'shiqchi uchun eng
qiyin parchalar va eng muhim iboralar registrlar orasidagi o'tish bo'limlariga tushmasligiga
g'amxo'rlik qilgan. Ham qo'shiqchilar, ham vokal o'qituvchilari nafaqat yangi boshlanuvchilar
uchun, balki tajribali ijrochilar uchun ham diapazonning bu qismlari qanchalik "xavfli"
ekanligini bilishadi. Rossini buni yaxshi bilar edi va shuning uchun asosiy vokal ohangini
xonanda uchun eng ishonchli bo'shliqda - diapazonning markazida jamlashga harakat qildi.
Bu ansamblning avji va finallari uchun zarur bo'lgan vokal energiyasini tejash imkonini
berdi.
Rossinining vokal ijrosi tajribasi, shuningdek, u o'tish davri registrida boshlangan uzoq
vokallardan qochganida ham yaqqol namoyon bo'ldi. Bir qator murakkab vokallarni yaratishda
bastakor ovoz uchun eng qulay bo'lgan qismdan boshladi va birinchi iboralar isinish kabi qisqa
bo'lishi kerak edi. Keyin u asta-sekin ovozning tessiturasini ko'tardi va vokallarning
davomiyligini oshirib, xonandaga ovozni butun shon-shuhratda namoyish etish imkoniyatini
berdi. Ushbu tamoyil ko'pchilik ariyalarda, ular qaysi ovoz turiga mo'ljallangan bo'lishidan qat'i
338

nazar, mavjud. Masalan, u Jazoirdagi "Italiana" operasidan "Languir per una bella" ariyasining
kulminatsion nuqtasini tashkil etadi. Lindoro qismi kontralto tenor Serafino Gentili uchun
yaratilgan, uning diapazoni C ga yetgan. Gentilining o'tish qismi, uning qismlariga ko'ra,
birinchi oktavaning F-sharp-G-sharp notalari edi. Languir per una bella ariyasining ovoz
diapazoni bir yarim oktava: F–C2. Bastakor parchani F1 bilan boshlaydi. Avvaliga u ovozni
pastki qismda kuylashga ruxsat beradi, so'ngra asta-sekin tessiturani juda silliq o'tish joyida
ko'taradi, o'tish G1 ga yetib boradi, lekin to'xtamaydi, asta-sekin ikki bardan so'ng A-flat1 ga
"sinab ko'radi", asta-sekin ohangni B-flat1 ga olib keladi, bu aniq, qo'shiqchida yangradi.
Yuqori registrdagi bo'g'in epizodlarida soprano va tenor kontraltino kabi baland ovozlar
yaxshi yangradi. Lindor ariyasi o‘zining cho‘zilgan epizodlari bilan nihoyatda baland
tessiturada vokal bo‘g‘inlari bilan bu tamoyilni tasdiqlaydi. Bu erda ham bel kantoning yana bir
tamoyili - ovoz tuzilishining simmetriya tamoyili: asosiy kuy to'rtta ikki barli iboraga
asoslangan bo'lib, xonanda vaqti-vaqti bilan nafas olish imkonini namoyon qiladi. Bundan
tashqari, bo'g'inli va yarim bo'g'inli iboralarning almashinishi yaxshi ovoz hosil bo'lishiga
yordam beradi[5; 323–333-b.].
Rossini vokal uslubining ajralmas xususiyati melodik o'zgaruvchanlik edi. Bastakor
operalaridagi nafis rang-baranglik namunalari son-sanoqsiz. U yoki bu darajada ular deyarli har
bir ariya va ko'pgina ansambllarda uchraydi, ular ovozning engilligi va cheksiz
moslashuvchanligi taassurotini yaratadigan nafis, nafis vokalizatsiyaga ega.
Rossini o'zining ba'zi ariyalarida da capo ariyasining eskirgan shakliga murojaat qilgan,
unda reprise yozilmagan. Bu xonandalar birinchi qismni shunchaki mexanik ravishda
takrorladilar degani emas edi.
Aksincha, bu shakl italyan operasida chuqur ildiz otgan, chunki u reprizada asl ohangning
vokal o'zgarishi uchun ijodiy imkoniyatlar yaratgan. Boshqa bastakorlar singari, Rossini ham
o'z ijrochilarining iste'dodi, didi va imkoniyatlariga ko'ra vokal qismini o'zgartirish va bezashga
ishonganligi sababli reprisalar yozmadi. Bastakor uch qismli repriz ariyasida birinchi qismning
o'zgarmas takrorlanishidan voz kechishi yoki bunday narsani ma'qullashi mumkinligini
tasavvur qilib bo'lmaydi. Agar ma'lum bir qo'shiqchida vokal improvizatsiya mahorati bo'lmasa,
bastakorning o'zi u uchun variatsiyalar yaratgan va operalarning takroriy spektakllari paytida,
asosiy qismlar boshqa rassomlar tomonidan ijro etilganda, Rossini o'zining kadenzalarini va
ular uchun variatsiyalarni qayta ishlagan. Ma'lumki, bastakor bo'sh vaqtlarida boshqa
kompozitorlarning operalarida da kapo ariyalarini qayta yozishni yaxshi ko'rardi [4]
Bundan tashqari, Rossinining vokal yozuvi shkala yoki miqyosga o'xshash parchalar
ko'rinishidagi vokalizatsiya bilan tavsiflanadi, kompozitor odatda eng yuqori hissiy shiddatli
daqiqalarda murojaat qiladi. Dramaning bunday daqiqalari har doim virtuoz vokal yordamida
ifodalanadi va ko'pincha "vaqtdan tashqari" tarozilar ketma-ketligi ayol qismlarida eng
ishonchli vositalardan biridir. Zolushkadagi ishqiy va g‘ayratli Anjelina, Jazoirdagi
italyanchadagi jozibali va makkor Izabella, “Ko‘l xonimi”dagi sevgilisi Yelenaga bag‘ishlangan

iztiroblar, Semiramidning hukmron, ammo ishtiyoqli mehribon bosh qahramoni ariyalarida
ularning ko‘pchiligi bor[6; 78–81b.].
Xulosa
Yaxshi vokal maktabiga ega bo'lgan Rossinining o'zi ham opera sahnalarida kastrati
deyarli qo'shiq aytmagan bir paytda o'z operalarini yozishga majbur bo'lgan. Avvaliga u
contralto en travesti uchun asosiy erkak qismlarini yaratish orqali chiqish yo'lini topdi.
Neapolda esa "shim" rollarida ayol kontraltosining o'rnini baland tenor - tenorekontraltino
egallagan. Hukmron talablar Rossinining vokal didi va qarashlariga mos kelmasdi, lekin u
ularga qarshi chiqmadi, balki yuzaga kelgan muammolarga amaliy yechim topdi. Rossini
operalarining bosh erkak rollarida yuqori tenorning kiritilishi o‘z davrida inqilobiy yangilik edi.
Ammo bu Rossinining innovatsion energiyasini emas, balki uning eski italyan bel kanto
tamoyilini o'zida aks ettirish istagini aks ettirdi: har qanday holatda ham etakchi erkak rolining
baland ovozini saqlab qolish - agar kastrato yoki kontralto en travesti bo'lmasa, hech
bo'lmaganda shunga o'xshash diapazonga ega tenor kontraltino.

Kirish. Taraqqiyotning bugungi bosqichida moda va dizayn inson hayotida muhim oʼrin
tutadi. Ma’lumki, kiyim nafaqat badanni himoya qiluvchi vosita, balki shaxsiyat, kayfiyat va
ijtimoiy maqomni ifodalovchi muhim madaniy belgi hisoblanadi. U kishining badiiy didini
ifodalaydi, madaniy saviyasini belgilaydi, shaxsini xarakterlaydi va kishiga nisbatan turli histuygʼular, masalan, jiddiylik, vazminlik, joʼshqinlik, sovuqlik, oddiylik uygʼotadi.
Inson hayoti davomida tevarak-atrofidagi narsalar, tabiat manzaralari, turli buyumlar,
kiyimlar, shakllarga, ularning rangiga e’tibor beradi, ulardan ma’naviy, ruhiy ozuqa oladi. O’zi

Kiyimni har tomonlama tavsiflashda uning uslubi, bichimi, vazifasi, matosi, bezaklari kabi
rang alohida ahamiyatga ega. Kiyim haqida birinchi taassurotni ham uning rangi tufayli olamiz.
Rang hissiy turtki beradi, bu atrofdagi obyektlarni idrok etishda juda kuchli omildir. Shu sababli
rang ilmiga oid bilimlar, ma’lumotlar ko’pchilik uchun qiziq va ahamiyatga egadir.
Tarixga nazar tashlasak, rang haqidagi ilm qadimdan mavjud, misol uchun, eramizdan
avvalgi IV asrda rang va rangning har xil ko’rinishlari haqida turli fikrlar aytilgan. Abu Rayhon
Beruniy oʻzining ʼKitob al-Javohir – maʼrifat al-Javohirʼ asarida 200 dan ortiq ranglarning
nomlarini sanab oʻtganlar va bu ranglarning kelib chiqishini ham yozib qoldirganlar. Sharqda
olimlar, shoirlar, musavvirlar, naqqoshlar, xattotlar ranglarning yuzdan ortiq turini ajrata
olganlar hamda ularning nomlarini, hattoki, har birining ramziy maʼnosini bilganlar.
Gyote, Leonardo da Vinchi, Evgeniy Delakrua, Vasiliy Kandinskiy, Igor Grabar kabi
san’at nazariyotchilari va rassomlarining ranglar psixologiyasi masalalari bilan
shug’ullanishlari bejiz emas.
“O‘zbek tilining izohli lug‘ati”da rang so‘zining quyidagi ma’nolari ko‘rsatilgan:1.
Boʻyash uchun ishlatiladigan modda, boʻyoq; 2. snt. Rangtasvirning asosiy ifoda va tasvir
vositasi; 3. Narsalarga surtilgan yoki singdirilgan boʻyoq, sir; 4. Biror narsaning oʻziga xos
boʻyogʻi; tus; 5. Kishining yuzidagi qizillik darajasi; 6. koʻchma - Gap, nutq, ohang va shu
kabilardagi nozik boʻyoq, tus; koʻrinish, jilva; 7. koʻchma - Jonlilik, fayz. Ma’lumotlardan
ko`rinadiki, rang so‘zi o‘z va ko‘chma ma’nolarda ham qo‘llanar ekan, uning badiiy san’at
turlaridan bo‘lgan tasviriy san’at hamda dizayn sohasida ham o‘ziga xos tushuncha anglatish
funksiyasi mavjud.
Rang tushunchasiga o’tgan asrlarda yashab o’tgan olimlar turlicha ta’riflar berishgan.
Misol uchun, qadimgi yunon faylasufi Aflotun “Rangning tabiati shaffoflik bo’lib, u yorug’lik
mahsuli. Rang faqat nur bor erda ko’rinib, qorong’ulikda mavjud emas. Nurni oq, qorong’ulikni
qora rang deb bilsak, demak asosiy ranglar oq va qora”, “xromatik ranglar nurning qorong’ulik
bilan turli miqdordagi aralashmasi”, – deb aytgan.
Rang — dizayndagi eng taʼsirli vizual elementlardan biri boʼlib, insonning hissiyoti,
kayfiyati va hatto xarid qilish qarorlariga ham taʼsir koʼrsatadi. U inson psixologiyasiga kuchli
taʼsir oʼtkazadi. Har bir rang oʼz ma’nosi, ramziy ifodasi va muayyan ta’siriga ega. Masalan,
qizil — energiya, kuch va ishtiyoq ramzi hamda diqqatni tortuvchi va faoliyatni
ragʼbatlantiruvchi rang hisoblanadi. Koʼk rang — tinchlik, ishonch,donolik, sadoqat,
barqarorlikni anglatadi va хotirjamlik, ishonch hissini uyg‘otadi. Yashil rang — tabiat, sogʼlik,
yangilanish, barqarorlik ва umid timsolidir, u кo‘zni tinchlantiradi, tabiiy muhitni eslatadi.
Qora rang esa sirlilik, kuchlilik va mukammallik, jiddiylik hamda qayg‘u timsoli bo’lib,
rasmiylik va o‘ziga ishonchni ifodalaydi, shu sababli rasmiy va klassik kiyimlarda keng
qoʼllaniladi. Oq rangni poklik, begunohlik, tozalik va soddalik ramzi sifatida nikoh kiyimlarida
ishlatiladi. U insonlarga хotirjamlik va musaffolik hissini beradi.

342

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Ranglarning maʼnolari madaniyatlarga qarab farq qiladi. Masalan, Osiyo mamlakatlarida
qizil – baxt va boylik ramzi sanalsa, Gʼarbda oq rang nikoh bilan bogʼliq. Shuning uchun kiyim
dizaynida rang tanlashda maqsadli auditoriya madaniyatini hisobga olish muhimdir.
Kiyimga rang tanlashda mavsumiy tendensiyalar
ham e’tiborga olinadi. Har
mavsumning oʼziga xos ranglari mavjud. Yozda yorqin va ochiq ranglar — sariq, och koʼk,
qizgʼish, qishda esa toʼq va pastel tonlar — toʼq koʼk, bordo, kulrang kabi ranglar urfda boʼladi.
Bu dizaynerlarga mavsumiy kolleksiya yaratishda yoʼl-yoʼriq beradi.
Kiyim dizaynida rang tanlovi nafaqat estetik, balki psixologik, madaniy va funksional
ahamiyatga egadir. Rang toʼgʼri tanlanganida, u insonning tashqi ko‘rinishiga chiroy
bagʼishlaydi, uning shaxsiyatini ifoda etadi va oʼzini ishonchli his qilishga yordam beradi.
Shuning uchun har bir dizayner rang psixologiyasini chuqur oʼrganishi va amaliyotda undan
samarali foydalanishi lozim.
Kiyim rangi nafaqat insonning kayfiyati va uslubini, balki inson gavdasi koʼrinishiga
vizual taʼsir koʼrsatadi. Shuning uchun dizaynerlar va oddiy xaridorlar ham oʼz tana tuzilishiga
mos rang tanlashni bilishi muhim. Toʼgʼri tanlangan rang insonning tashqi qiyofasini
chiroyliroq, tanadagi baʼzi nuqsonlarni yashirishi yoki kamroq koʼrsatishi mumkin. Ranglar
gavdani “katta” yoki “kichik” koʼrsatish xususiyatiga ega, masalan, yorugʼ ranglar (oq, och
sariq, pastel tonlar) inson gavdasini kattaroq, kengroq qilib koʼrsatadi, hajm qoʼshadi. Toʼq va
qora ranglar esa aksincha tanani ingichkaroq, muvozanatli qilib koʼrsatadi va salobat,
mukammallik tuygʼusini uygʼotadi.
Bir xil tusdagi sidirgʼa gazlamadan tikilgan kiyimlar boʼyni uzunroq koʼrsatsa, ajralib
turuvchi, kontrast ranglar esa boʼyni qisqartiradi.
Kiyim rangini tanlashda inson terisining rangi ham e’tiborga olinаdi, masalan, teri rangi
oq boʼlgan insonlarga koʼproq toʼq yoki kontrast rangli kiyimlar yarashadi, aksincha terisi rangi
toʼqroq boʼlganlarga yorqin, pastel yoki yorugʼ rangli kiyimlar chiroyli koʼrinadi.
Undan tashqari rang shunday xususiyatga egaki, u tana qismlarini ajratib koʼrsatishi yoki
yashirishi mumkin. Misol uchun, qora yoki toʼq rangli shim va och rangli kofta kiyilsa, tananing
yuqori qismiga diqqat tortiladi, pastki qism «ortida» qoladi. Аksincha och shim, toʼq koftada
tananing pastki qism koʼproq koʼzga tashlanadi.
Kiyim dizaynida kiyimga rang tanlashda uning uslubiga eʼtibor qaratish lozim. Bu juda
muhim, chunki rang va uslub bir-biriga mos kelmasa, kiyimdagi umumiy obraz notoʼgʼri, hatto
koʼngilbuzar koʼrinishda boʼlishi mumkin. Uslub kiyimning kayfiyati va mazmunini belgilaydi.
Misol uchun klassik uslub rasmiy, jiddiy, universal boʼlganligi uchun oq, qora, toʼq koʼk,
soʼlgʼin, bordo, kul rang, koʼk, malla, pastel kabi boshqa neytral ranglar tuslaridan iborat rang
gammasi toʼgʼri keladi.
Boxo (boho) uslubi erkin, tabiiy, etnik xususiyatlari bilan ajralib turgani uchun yer tuslari
(qumrang, sabz, toʼq sariq) va tabiiy ranglar mos tushadi.
Strit-stayl (street-style) – koʼcha uslubi hisoblanib, yoshlarga xos. Bu yerda neon, kontrast
va yarqin ranglar oʼrinli boʼladi.

Kiyim rangi uslubni kuchaytiradi yoki unga xalaqit berishi mumkin. Tasavvur qiling,
juda rasmiy (klassik) kostyumga yorugʼ neon rang qoʼshilsa, uning rasmiy kayfiyati
yoʼqoladi. Yoki, romantik uslubdagi kiyimda qattiq va juda toʼq ranglar obrazni
ogʼirlashtirishi mumkin.
Ranglar "aloqa tili"ning bir qismi hisoblanadi. Ular kiyimning vazifasini aks ettiradi,
masalan, sport kiyimlarida ishonch va harakatni ifoda etadigan tiniq ranglar (koʼk, sabz, oq),
ishlatilsa, shik uslubida nafis va muvozanatli ranglar (krem, shoirang, bordo)dan
foydalaniladi.
Quyida kiyim uslublari uchun tavsiya etilgan ranglar jadvalini tavsiya etamiz:

Yumshoq va nafis obrazlar uchun,
romantik kayfiyatni ifodalaydi.
Tabiiylik va erkinlikni aks ettiradi.

Faoliyat va harakat bilan bogʼliq
boʼlgan yorugʼ va quvvatli ranglar.
Sanʼat asaridek yaratilgan obrazlar,
originallik birinchi oʼrinda.

Demak, kiyimda uslub va rang bir-biriga muvofiq boʼlishi shart, aks holda obrazda
beqarorlik seziladi. Shuning uchun dizayner har doim uslub, tana tuzilishi, maqsad va rang
psixologiyasini birgalikda tahlil qilishi kerak.
Dizayner yangi yaratilayotgan kiyim uchun rang tanlashda nimalarga eʼtibor qaratishi
lozim?
Fikrimizcha, yangi yaratilayotgan kiyim modeli uchun dizayner rang tanlashda
quyidagilarga tayanishi lozim:
–
kiyimni moʼljallangan kiyish maqsadiga: toʼy, rasmiy uchrashuv, kundalik hayot,
yozgi dam olish va hokazo. Har bir vaziyat oʼziga xos rang talab qiladi. Masalan, rasmiy
uchrashuv uchun toʼq va soʼlgʼin ranglar, to’y-hashamlar uchun esa jonli va dinamik ranglar
mos keladi;
– kiyimning qaysi mavsumga moʼljallanganligiga: yozda ochiq va yorugʼ ranglar (och
koʼk, sariq, qizgʼish), qishda esa toʼq va pastel ranglar (toʼq koʼk, bordo, kulrang) tavsiya
qilinadi;
–
yosh xususiyatlariga: yoshlarga jonli, kreativ, eksperimental ranglar, kattalarga
muvozanatli, ishonch bagʼishlovchi ranglar mos keladi;
344

–
teri rangi va tashqi koʼrinishga:
–
ranglarning psixologik taʼsiriga;
– mato turiga: masalan bir xil rang turli matolarda boshqacha koʼrinishi mumkin
(masalan, ipakda yorqinroq, paxtada soʼngʼin);
–
dizayn uslubiga: minimalizm, etnik, futurizm va h.k;
–
moda tendentsiyalariga: har yili Pantone yoki boshqa moda uylari yil rangini eʼlon
qiladi. Аgar dizayner bozorda faoliyat yuritishni maqsad qilgan boʼlsa, trend ranglardan
xabardor boʼlishi shart.
Xulosa qilib aytish mumkinki, kiyim dizaynida rang — bu nafaqat estetik ko‘rinish,
balki inson psixologiyasiga, kayfiyatiga va ijtimoiy taassurotlarga ta’sir qiluvchi muhim
vositadir. Ranglar yordamida dizaynerlar kiyimga jon bag‘ishlab, uning xarakterini ochib
beradilar. Har bir rang o‘ziga xos ma’no kasb etib, turli madaniyatlarda turlicha talqin
qilinadi. Shuningdek, rang tanlovi fasl, yosh, kasb, va muhitga mos ravishda tanlanishi
lozim.
Kiyim dizaynida ranglar uyg‘unligini to‘g‘ri tanlash — muvaffaqiyatli moda
mahsulotini yaratishning asosi hisoblanadi.

is placed on the way these ornaments convey cultural narratives through shape, color, and

Kirish. Avvalo, har qanday xalqning moddiy va ma’naviy madaniyati uning amaliy
san’atida o‘z aksini topadi. Shu jumladan, o‘zbek xalqining tarixiy-madaniy merosida keramika
san’ati muhim o‘rin tutadi. Ayniqsa, keramik bezaklar nafaqat estetik go‘zallikni, balki ramziy,
semantik va falsafiy ma’nolarni ham o‘z ichiga oladi [2, 319-329].
Shu sababli, ushbu maqolada milliy keramika naqshlarining estetik ko‘rinishlari va
ularning ortida yotgan ramziy qatlamlar, ya’ni semantik jihatlari ilmiy-nazariy nuqtai nazardan
yoritiladi. Shuningdek, ularning tarixiy ildizlari, hududiy farqlari va madaniy ahamiyati chuqur
o‘rganiladi. Bundan tashqari, naqshlar orqali xalqning dunyoqarashi va qadriyatlari qanday
ifoda topishi asosiy e’tibor markazida bo‘ladi.
Metodologiya. Maqola tadqiqotida kompleks yondashuv qo‘llanildi. Avvalo, vizualsemiotik tahlil asosida naqshlarning shakli, tarkibi va kompozitsiyasi chuqur o‘rganildi. Bu
uslub naqshlar orqali ifodalangan ramziy ma’nolarni aniqlashga imkon berdi. Shu bilan birga,
tarixiy-madaniy yondashuv yordamida naqshlarning paydo bo‘lish tarixiga nazar tashlandi.
Xususan, arxiv manbalari, muzey to‘plamlari va qadimiy keramika namunalaridagi bezaklar
o‘rganildi.
Shuningdek, hududiy qiyosiy tahlil orqali turli viloyatlardagi uslublar taqqoslab chiqildi.
Masalan, Rishton, G‘ijduvon, Xiva va Samarqand maktablariga xos naqshlar o‘zaro
taqqoslanib, ularning estetik va semantik jihatlari o‘rganildi. Ayniqsa, ularning rang
ishlatishdagi farqlari, naqsh tuzilmasi va ikonografik elementlari aniqlik bilan tahlil qilindi.
Bundan tashqari, intertekstual yondashuv orqali milliy naqshlar va xalq og‘zaki ijodi
(maqollar, ertaklar, to‘y marosimlari) o‘rtasidagi bog‘liqlik ham ko‘rib chiqildi. Ayniqsa, ayrim
naqshlar xalq orasidagi qadriyatlar, e’tiqodlar va ramzlar tizimi bilan chambarchas bog‘liq
ekanligi aniqladi.
Ushbu metodlar uyg‘unligi orqali maqolada har tomonlama, ishonchli va nazariy
asoslangan ilmiy tahlil amalga oshirildi. Natijada, faqat tashqi go‘zallik emas, balki naqshlar
ortidagi chuqur madaniy va falsafiy mazmunlar ham ochib berildi.
Natijalar. Tadqiqot natijalariga ko‘ra, o‘zbek milliy keramika naqshlari quyidagi asosiy
estetik va semantik guruhlarga ajraldi. Har bir guruh o‘zining ramziy mazmuni va hududiy
xususiyatlari bilan ajralib turadi.
1. Geometrik naqshlar – masalan, girih, yulduz, doira – mukammallik, muvozanat va
abadiylik g‘oyalarini bildiradi. Bu naqshlar ayniqsa Rishton va Samarqand maktablariga xos
bo‘lib, ularda naqshlar simmetrik tuzilishi va takrorlanuvchi ritmlar orqali kosmik uyg‘unlikni
347

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

aks ettiradi. Masalan, 8 qirrali yulduz shakli qadimiy kosmogoniyaga ishora qilib, "kosmik
uyg‘unlik" va "abadiy tartib"ni anglatadi [3].

Boshqa tomondan, bu naqshlar faqat dekorativ element sifatida emas, balki diniy-falsafiy
ramzni ham ifodalaydi. Ular orqali naqsh bezagi orqali mukammallik va ilohiy tartib g‘oyalari
yuksak darajada ifodalanadi.
2. O‘simliksimon (islimiy) naqshlar – barg, gul, shox kabi elementlar – o‘sish, hayotiylik,
go‘zallik ramzlari bilan bog‘liq. Ayniqsa, G‘ijduvon maktabida keng qo‘llanadi. Ushbu
naqshlar orqali inson va tabiat o‘rtasidagi uyg‘unlik timsollanadi [4].

Masalan, anor tasviri nasl davomiyligi va baraka bilan bog‘liq bo‘lsa, g‘o‘za mehnat va
hosildorlik belgisi sifatida ko‘p ishlatiladi. Shu bilan birga, bu tasvirlar xalq orasidagi
qadriyatlar va urf-odatlar bilan bevosita bog‘liqligini ko‘rsatadi.
3. Zoomorfik naqshlar - Baliq, qush, arxar kabi hayvon obrazlari qadimgi totemik
e’tiqodlarning keramika san’atiga singib ketgan timsollaridir. Ular, ko‘pincha, himoya, baraka
va kuch ramzi sifatida qadrlanadi. Xususan, arxar shoxi yoki burgut qanoti kabi elementlar
nafaqat dekorativ, balki ma’naviy anglamga ega bo‘lgan belgilar sifatida xizmat qiladi.

348

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Shu bilan birga, bunday tasvirlar shamanistik qatlamlarning keramika san’atiga qanday
ta’sir ko‘rsatganini ham ko‘rsatadi. Bu esa milliy madaniyat qatlamlarining bir-biri bilan
uyg‘unlashgan ko‘rinishini ta’minlaydi.
4. Ranglar semantikasi. Naqshlardagi ranglar ham alohida semantik qatlamga ega. Ular
nafaqat estetik joziba yaratadi, balki ramziy ma’no yuklaydi:
Ko‘k – osmon, ruhiy uyg‘unlik (Rishton maktabida eng ko‘p ishlatiladi);
Yashil – hayot, tabiat va baraka;
Qizil – energiya, kuch, hayotiylik;
Oq – poklik, muqaddaslik, nur; [1].
Shunday qilib, ranglar ham estetik go‘zallik bilan birga chuqur ramziy ma’noga ega. Ular
orqali naqshlarning umumiy ruhiy ohangi va madaniy xabari shakllanadi.
Shunday qilib, milliy keramika naqshlari orqali xalqning estetik didi, diniy-falsafiy
dunyoqarashi va tarixiy xotirasi mujassam ifoda topgan. Bu naqshlar nafaqat bezak sifatida,
balki xalq ruhiyati va identitetini aks ettiruvchi muhim madaniy kodlar sifatida qaralishi zarur.
Munozara. Ushbu maqolada o‘rganilgan o‘zbek milliy keramika naqshlari estetik va
semantik jihatdan boy merosning ajralmas qismi ekani yaqqol namoyon bo‘ldi. Avvalo shuni
ta’kidlash kerakki, naqshlar oddiy bezak emas, balki xalqning tarixiy xotirasi, diniy-falsafiy
dunyoqarashi va estetik didining in’ikosi sifatida namoyon bo‘ladi. Bundan tashqari, ularning
har bir elementi ramziy ma’no yuklab, milliy identitetni shakllantirishda muhim o‘rin egallaydi.
Aytish joizki, geometrik naqshlarning mukammallik va uyg‘unlik ramzi sifatida
qo‘llanilishi Islom madaniy merosi bilan chambarchas bog‘liq. Girih naqshlarining
takrorlanuvchanligi orqali vaqt va makon tushunchalari ifodalanadi, bu esa ilohiylik g‘oyasi
bilan uyg‘unlashadi. Shu nuqtai nazardan qaralganda, bu naqshlar inson tafakkurining falsafiy
ifodasidir.
Boshqa tomondan, o‘simliksimon naqshlarning keng tarqalganligi ularning hayot,
baraka, go‘zallik va tabiat bilan bog‘liqligini ko‘rsatadi. Bu naqshlar orqali inson va tabiat
o‘rtasidagi uyg‘unlik, shuningdek, zamin va urug‘ qadriyatlari ifoda topadi. Xususan, anor va
g‘o‘za tasvirlari xalq hayoti bilan bevosita aloqador bo‘lib, ular orqali xalq mehnatsevarligi va
hosildorlikka bo‘lgan intilishi aks ettiriladi.
Shuningdek, zoomorfik tasvirlarning mavjudligi qadimgi totemik e’tiqodlarning izlari
saqlanib qolganini ko‘rsatadi. Baliq, qush, arxar singari hayvon obrazlari nafaqat estetik
ko‘rinishga ega, balki xalq ruhiyati va mifologiyasi bilan bog‘liq ma’naviy ma’noni ham
anglatadi. Shu sababli, bu tasvirlarni shunchaki bezak deb emas, balki arxaik ong mahsuli
sifatida baholash lozim.
Ranglar semantikasi ham alohida tahlilga loyiq. Darhaqiqat, ranglar orqali milliy ruh,
hissiyotlar va qadriyatlar ifoda topadi. Masalan, ko‘k rang orqali ruhiy poklik va samoviy
uyg‘unlik, yashil orqali hayotiylik va baraka, qizil orqali kuch va energiya, oq orqali esa poklik
va muqaddaslik obrazlari beriladi. Demak, har bir rang xalq estetik dunyoqarashini belgilovchi
muhim unsurdir.
349

_____________________ Qo‘qon DPI. Ilmiy xabarlar 2025-yil 4 -son _________________B seriya

Demak, milliy keramika naqshlari O‘zbekiston madaniy merosining vizual-kognitiv
ifodasi bo‘lib, ular orqali xalqning ma’naviy qadriyatlari, diniy-falsafiy tushunchalari va estetik
qarashlari namoyon bo‘ladi. Shu bois, bu naqshlarni zamonaviy dizayn va madaniy targ‘ibot
vositalarida to‘laqonli qo‘llash, ularning zamonaviy kontekstda ham davomiyligini ta’minlash
lozim.
Xulosa. Yuqoridagi tahlillardan kelib chiqib, o‘zbek milliy keramika naqshlari nafaqat
estetik jozibadorlikka ega, balki xalqning tarixiy, madaniy va diniy dunyoqarashini ifodalovchi
muhim semiotik tizimdir. Tadqiqot natijalari shuni ko‘rsatadiki, geometrik, o‘simliksimon va
zoomorfik naqshlar o‘zbek xalqining qadimiy dunyoqarashi, urf-odatlari va ma’naviy
qadriyatlarini vizual shaklda aks ettiradi. Ranglarning semantik yuklamasi esa bu naqshlarning
ta’sirchanligini yanada oshiradi.
Bundan tashqari, milliy naqshlarning hududiy xususiyatlari – masalan, Rishton,
G‘ijduvon yoki Samarqand maktablariga xos o‘ziga xos naqsh uslublari – o‘zbek xalqining
estetik tafakkuri va badiiy ifoda vositalarining xilma-xilligidan dalolat beradi. Ayniqsa,
naqshlar orqali xalqning tabiatga munosabati, mehnatga e’tibori va ma’naviy qadriyatlari
mujassam topgani alohida e’tiborga loyiq.
Xulosa qilib aytganda, milliy keramika naqshlari nafaqat o‘zining go‘zalligi bilan, balki
xalqning ma’naviy olamini, estetik didini, tarixiy va dini qadriyatlarini ifodalashi bilan ham
yuksak ahamiyatga ega. Ushbu naqshlar kelajak avlodlarga o‘tmishdan meros qolgan madaniy
kod sifatida uzatilishi va zamonaviy dizayn, san’at va arxitektura sohalarida faol ravishda
qo‘llanilishi maqsadga muvofiqdir.
